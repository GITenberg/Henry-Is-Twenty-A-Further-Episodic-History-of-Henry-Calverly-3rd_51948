    <h2>
      OF PATTERNS AND PERSONS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t would be
      ungracious to let this book go out into a preoccupied world without some
      word of gratitude to those who have written regarding the young Henry as
      he has appeared from month to month in a magazine. The letters have been
      the kindliest and most stimulating imaginable; and have surprised me, for
      I have never found it easy to picture Henry as a popular hero of fiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He isn't, of course, a hero at all. His weaknesses are too plain&mdash;the
      little evidences of vanity in him, his selfcentred moments, his errant
      susceptibilities&mdash;and heroes can't have weaknesses. And heroes&mdash;in
      any well-regulated pattern-story&mdash;must 'turn out well.' Henry, in
      this book, doesn't really turn out at all. His success in Episode X is a
      rather alarming accident. I think he'll do well enough, when he's forty or
      so. At twenty, no. He has huge doses of life's medicine yet to swallow.
      And all his problems are complicated by the touch of genius that is in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing: there couldn't have been a Mamie Wilcox in our
      pattern-story. And certainly not a Corinne. Hardly even a Martha. For a
      'divided love interest' destroys your pattern. Yet Marthas, Corinnes,
      Mamies occur everywhere. So I can't very well apologise for their presence
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      We might, of course, have had Henry overthrow the Old Cinch in Sunbury;
      clean up the town. But he didn't happen to be a St George that summer. And
      then, so many heroes of pattern-stories, these two decades, have slain
      municipal dragons!
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have listened in a deeper humility to the worldly wisdom of Uncle
      Arthur. But he didn't. He had to live his own life, not Uncle Arthur's.
      His way was the harder, but he couldn't help that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have liked to pursue further the Mildred-Humphrey romance;
      including Arthur V. and the curious triangle that resulted; but the crisis
      didn't come in that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      And against the temptation to dwell with Madame Watt and her husband I
      have had, here, to set my face. Though something of that story will be
      told in a book yet to come, dealing with an older, changed Henry. The
      richly dramatic career of <i>Madame</i> underlay the irony of Henry's
      marriage; and we shall have to deal with that, or at least with the events
      that grew out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have said that Henry would turn out well enough in time. From the angle
      of the pattern-story this obviously couldn't be. It would be said that if
      he <i>was</i> ever to succeed he should have got started by this time in
      habits of industry and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I won't say that this is nonsense, but instead will quote from the
      autobiography of Charles Francis Adams (Houghton Mifflin Company, 1916).
      Mr Adams, from his fifteenth to his twenty-fifth year, kept a diary. Then
      he sealed the volumes in a package. Thirty years later he opened the
      package and read every word. He says:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The revelation of myself to myself was positively shocking.... It wasn't
      that the thing was bad or that my record was discreditable; it was worse!
      It was silly. That it was crude, goes without saying. <i>That</i> I didn't
      mind! But I did blush and groan and swear over its unmistakable,
      unconscious immaturity and ineptitude, its conceit, its weakness and its
      cant.... As I finished each volume it went into the fire; and I stood over
      it until the last leaf was ashes.... I have never felt the same about
      myself since. I now humbly thank fortune that I have got almost through
      life without making a conspicuous ass of myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Adams, immediately after the period covered by the diary, plunged into
      the Civil War, and emerged with the well-earned brevet rank of
      brigadier-general. He was later eminent as publicist, author,
      administrator, a recognised leader of thought in a troublous time. He
      became president of the Union Pacific Railroad. And at the last he was the
      subject of a memorial address by the Honorable Henry Cabot Lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Henry is still several years short of twenty-five perhaps there is hope
      for him.

      I&mdash;THE IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
    </h2>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was late May in
      Sunbury, Illinois, and twenty minutes past eight in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spacious lawns and the wide strips of turf between sidewalk and
      roadway in every avenue and street were lush with crowding young blades of
      green. The maples, oaks, and elms were vivid with the exuberant youth of
      the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the village, brisk young men, care-worn men of middle age, a
      few elderly men were hurrying toward the old red-brick station whence the
      eight-twenty-nine would shortly carry them into the dust and sweat and
      smoke of a business day in Chicago. The swarms of sleepy-eyed clerks,
      book-keepers, office boys and girl stenographers had gone in on the
      seven-eleven and the seven-thirty-two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along Simpson Street the grocers, in their aprons, already had out their
      sidewalk racks heaped with seasonable vegetables and fruits (out-of-season
      delicacies had not then become commonplaces of life in Sunbury;
      strawberries appeared when the local berries were ripe, not sooner). The
      two butcher shops were decorated with red and buff carcasses hung in rows.
      A whistling, coatless youth had just swept out Donovan's drug store and
      was wiping off the marble counter before the marble and glass soda
      fountain. Through the windows of the Sunbury National Bank Alfred Knight
      could be seen filling the inkwells and putting out fresh blotters and
      pens. The neat little restaurant known as 'Stanley's' (the Stanleys were a
      respectable coloured couple) was still nearly full of men who ate ham and
      eggs, pounded beefsteak, fried potatoes, and buckwheat cakes, and drank
      huge cups of gray-brown coffee; with, at the rear tables, two or three
      family groups. And from numerous boarding-houses and dormitories in the
      northern section of the overgrown village students of both sexes were
      converging on the oak-shaded campus by the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of Sunbury appeared to be up and about the business of the day; all,
      perhaps, except Henry Calverly, 3rd, who sat, dressed except for his coat,
      heavy-eyed, a hair brush in either hand, hands resting limp on knees, on
      the edge of his narrow iron bed. This, in Mrs Wilcox's boardinghouse in
      Douglass Street, one block south of Simpson; top floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the present reader has, by chance, had earlier acquaintance with Henry,
      it should be explained that he is now to be pictured not as a youth of
      eighteen going on nineteen but as a young man of twenty going on
      twenty-one.
    </p>
    <p>
      That figure, twenty-one, of significance in the secret thoughts of any
      growing boy, was of peculiar, stirring significance to the sensitive,
      imaginative Henry. It marked the beginning of what is sometimes termed
      Life. It suggested alarming but interesting responsibilities. On that day,
      beginning with the stroke of the midnight hour, guardians ceased to
      function and independence set in. One was a citizen. One voted. In Henry's
      case, the crowning symbol of manhood would be deferred a year, as Election
      Day was to fall on the fifth of November and his birthday was the seventh;
      but that so trivial a mere fact bore small weight in the face of potential
      citizenship might have been indicated by the faint blonde fringe along his
      upper lip. This fringe was a new venture. He stroked it much of the time,
      and stole glances at it in mirrors. He could twist it up a little at the
      ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of him indicated a taste that was hardly bent on the inexpensive
      as such. His duck trousers (this was the middle nineties) were smartly
      creased and rustled with starch. His white canvas shoes were not
      'sneakers' but had heavy soles and half-heels of red rubber. His coat,
      lying now across the iron tube that marked the foot of the bed, was a
      double-breasted blue serge, unlined, well-tailored. The hat, hung on a
      mirror post above the 'golden oak' bureau, was of creamy white felt. He
      had given up spectacles for nose glasses with a black silk cord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly two years earlier his mother had died. He had lived on, caught in a
      drift of time and circumstance, keeping, without any particular plan, this
      little room with its sloping ceiling. The price was an item, of course&mdash;six
      dollars a week for room and board. You couldn't do better in Sunbury, even
      then. Memories haunted the place, naturally enough. Loneliness had dwelt
      close with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's picture, in a silver frame, stood at the right of the
      pincushion; at the left, in hammered brass ('repoussé work') was a
      'cabinet size' photograph of Martha Caldwell. A woven-wire rack on the
      wall held half a hundred snapshots of girls, boys, and groups, in about a
      third of which figured Martha's smiling, sensible, pleasantly freckled
      face. A guitar in an old green bag leaned against the wall behind his
      mother's old trunk; it had not been out of the bag in more than a year. An
      assortment of neck-ties hung over the gas-jet by the bureau. Tacked about
      on the wall were six or eight copies of Gibson girls; rather good copies,
      barringva certain stiffness of line. On the seat in the one dormer window
      reposed two cushions, one covered with college pennants, the other with
      cigar bands laboriously cross-stitched together; both from, the hands of
      Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's little bookcase was not uninteresting. It contained the following
      books: Daily Strength for Daily Needs, Browning, Trollope, and Hawthorne
      in sets, Sonnets, from the Portuguese, Words often Mispronounced,
      Longfellow, complete in one fat volume. Red Line Edition, and Six Thousand
      Puzzles, all of which had been his mother's; Green's History of the
      English People, Boswell's Johnson, both largely uncut, and the Discourses
      of Epictetus, which three had come as Christmas or birthday gifts; and
      exactly one volume, a work by an obscure author (who was pictured in the
      frontispiece with a bristling moustache and intensely knit brows) entitled
      Will Power and Self Mastery, which offered the only clue as to Henry's own
      taste in book buying.
    </p>
    <p>
      His taste in reading was another matter. The novels and romances he had
      devoured during certain periods of his teens had mostly come from the
      Sunbury Free Public Library. Lately, however, apart from thrilling moments
      with The Prisoner of Zenda, Under the Red Rose, and The Princess Aline, he
      had found difficulty in reading at all. Something was stirring within him,
      something restlessly positive, an impulse to give out rather than take in.
      Though he had, at intervals, lunged with determination at the Green and
      the Boswell. This effort, indeed, had been repeated so many times that he
      occasionally caught himself speaking of these authors as if he had read
      them exhaustively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bottom drawer of the bureau was a third full of unfinished manuscripts&mdash;attempts
      at novels, short stories, poems, plays&mdash;each faithfully reflecting
      its immediate source of inspiration. There were paragraphs that might have
      been written by a little Dickens; there were thinly diluted specimens of
      Dumas, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Richard Harding Davis, Thackeray. The rest
      was all Kipling, prose and verse. Everybody was writing Kipling then.
    </p>
    <p>
      A step sounded in the hall. The knob turned softly; the door opened a
      little way; and the thinnish, moderately pretty face of Mamie Wilcox
      appeared&mdash;pale blue eyes with the beginnings of hollows beneath them,
      fair skin, straight hay-coloured hair, wisps of it straying down across
      forehead and cheek, thin nose, soft but rather sulky mouth. She was
      probably twenty-two or twenty-three at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      All she said was, 'Oh!'&mdash;very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wonder you wouldn't knock!' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wonder you wouldn't get up before noon!' she responded smartly, but still
      in that cautious voice; then added, 'Here, I'll leave the towels, and come
      back.' And she slipped into the room, a heavier and more shapely figure of
      a girl than was suggested by the face, a girl in a full-length gingham
      apron and little shoes with unexpectedly high heels; not 'French' heels,
      but the sloping style known then as 'military.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      Henry's colour was rising a little. He cleared his throat, and said,
      mumbling, 'Leave anything you like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll do just that,'&mdash;she turned, with a flirt of her apron and
      stood, between washstand and door, surveying him&mdash;'what I like, and
      nothing more.'... Her eyes wandered now from him to the picture at the
      left of the pincushion, then to the snapshots on the wall, and she smiled,
      very self-contained, very knowing, with the expression that the young call
      'sarcastic.' The adjective came to mind. Henry's colour was mounting
      higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pretty snappy to-day, ain't we?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, when we're snapped at,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence that ran on into seconds and tens of seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, acting on an impulse of astonishing suddenness, he sprang toward
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With almost equal agility she stepped away. But he caught one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the door-knob in her other hand. She drew the door open, then,
      indecisively, pushed it nearly to.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Be careful!' she whispered. 'They'll hear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a small effort to free her hand. For a moment they stood tugging
      at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry spoke, in an effort to appear the off-hand man of the world he
      assuredly was not, his voice sounded weak and husky.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whew&mdash;strong!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suppose I slapped.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Slap all you like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What would Martha Caldwell say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a gloomy sort of anger on Henry's red face. He jerked her
      violently toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stop! You're hurting my wrist!' With which she yielded a little. He found
      himself about to take her in his arms. He heard her whispering&mdash;'For
      Heaven's sake be careful! They'll surely hear!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was most unhappy. He pushed her roughly away, and rushed to the
      window.,
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew from the silence that she was lingering. He hated her. And
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: 'Well, you needn't get mad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, slowly, cautiously, she let herself out. He heard her moving
      composedly along the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt weak. And deeply guilty. For a long time this moment had been a
      possibility; now it had taken place. What if some one had seen her come
      in! What if she should come again! What if she should tell!...
    </p>
    <p>
      He found one hair brush on the floor, the other on the bed, and brushed
      his hair; donned his coat, buttoning it and smoothing it down about his
      shapely torso with a momentary touch of complacency; glanced at the
      mirror; twisted up his moustache; then stood waiting for his colour to go
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, with one of his quick impulses, he sprang at the bookcase, drew
      out the <i>Epictetus</i>&mdash;it was a little book, bound in 'ooze' calf
      of an olive-green colour&mdash;and read these words (the book opened
      there):&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'To the rational animal only is the irrational intolerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered the book and repeated the phrase aloud.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      A little later&mdash;red about the ears, and given to sudden starts when
      the swinging pantry doors opened to let a student waiter in or out&mdash;he
      sat, quite erect, in the dining room and bolted a boarding-house breakfast
      of stewed prunes, oatmeal, fried steak, fried potatoes, fried mush
      swimming in brown sugar syrup, and coffee. The <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>
      lay at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he walked&mdash;stiffly self-conscious, book under arm&mdash;over
      to Simpson Street, and took a chair and an <i>Inter Ocean</i> at Schultz
      and Schwartz's, among the line of those waiting to be shaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      This accomplished he paused outside, on the curb, to pencil this entry in
      a red pocket account-book:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shave&mdash;10 c.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He wavered when passing Donovan's; stepped in and consumed a frosted maple
      shake. Which necessitated the further entry in the red book:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Soda&mdash;10 c.'
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of Berger's grocery he met Martha Caldwell. They walked together
      to the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha was a sizable girl, about as tall as Henry, with large blue eyes,
      an attractively short nose, abundant brown hair coiled away under her flat
      straw hat, and a general air of good sense. Martha was really a
      goodlooking young woman, and would have been popular had not Henry stood
      in her light. She had a small gift at drawing (the Gibson copies in
      Henry's room were hers) and danced gracefully enough. Monday and Thursday
      evenings were his regular calling times; and there were so many other
      evenings when he was expected to take her to this house or that with 'the
      crowd' that the other local 'men' had long since given up calling at her
      house. But they were not engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion there was constraint between them. They spoke of the
      lovely weather. She, knowing Henry pretty well, looked with some curiosity
      at his book. Henry glanced sidelong at her across a wide bottomless gulf,
      and stroked his moustache. He was groping desperately for words. He began
      to resent her. He presented an outer front of stem self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner they stopped and stood in a silence that grew rapidly
      embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her eyes and dug with the point of her parasol in the turf by
      the stone walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust both hands into his trousers' pockets, spread his feet, and
      stared across at the long veranda of the Sunbury House. It seemed to him
      that he had never been so unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you'&mdash;Martha began; hesitated; went on&mdash;'were you thinking
      of coming around this evening?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;it's Thursday, ain't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' she said, 'it's Thursday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen, Martha!' Was it possible that she suspected something? But how
      could she! His ears were getting red again. He knew it. She must never,
      never know about Mamie!... 'Listen, I may have to go down to Mrs Arthur V.
      Henderson's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh,' she murmured, 'that musicale.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' Eagerness was creeping into his voice. 'Anne Mayer Stelton. She's
      been over studying with Marchesi, you know. Mrs Henderson asked specially
      to have me cover it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why don't you go?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;you see how it is. Of course, I'd hate&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd better go.' Saying which Martha turned away down Filbert Avenue,
      and left him standing there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bit his lip; pulled at his moustache. 'I ought to do something for
      her,' he thought. 'Buy some flowers&mdash;or a box of Devoe's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an idle thought; for the day, Thursday, lay much too close to the
      financially lean end of the week to permit of flowers or candy. And he
      hadn't asked anywhere for a dollar of credit these nearly two years.
      Still, he felt faintly the warmth of his kindly intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      It didn't seem altogether right to let her go like that. They had not
      before drifted so near a quarrel. On the farther side of the street he
      paused, and glanced down the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      A smart trap that he had never seen before had pulled up, midway of the
      block. An impeccable coachman sat stiffly upon an indubitable box. A man
      who appeared to have reddish hair, dressed in a brown cutaway suit and
      Derby hat, a man with a pronounced if close-cropped red moustache and a
      suggestively interesting band of mourning about his left sleeve, was
      leaning out, gracefully, graciously, talking to&mdash;Martha. And Martha
      was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry moved on, little confused pangs of quite unreasonable jealousy
      stabbing at his heart, and entered the business-and-editorial office of <i>The
      Weekly Voice of Sunbury</i>, where he worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he laid down the <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i> and asked Humphrey
      Weaver, untitled editor of the paper (old man Boice, the owner, would
      never permit any one but himself to be known by that title), for the
      galley proofs of the week's 'Personal Mention.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He found this item:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr James B. Merchant, Jr., of Greggs, Merchant &amp; Co., was a guest of
      Mr and Mrs Ames at the Country Club on Saturday evening. Mr Merchant has
      leased for the summer the apartment of M. B. Wills, on Lower Filbert
      Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the man! James B. Merchant was a bachelor, rich, a famous
      cotillion leader on the South Side, Chicago, an only son of the original
      James B. Merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Martha had gone to the Country Club Saturday with the Ameses. This
      curious tension between himself and Martha had then first bordered on the
      acute. Mr Ames disapproved of Henry; he felt that Martha shouldn't have
      gone. And now, of course, her lack of consideration for himself was
      leading her into new complications.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat moodily fingering the papers on the littered, ink-stained table
      that served him for a desk. He was disturbed, uncomfortable, but couldn't
      settle on what seemed a proper mental attitude. He was jealous; but he
      mustn't let his jealousy carry him to the point of taking a definite stand
      with Martha, because&mdash;well...
    </p>
    <p>
      Life seemed very difficult.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <i>Voice</i> office occupied what had once been a shop, opposite the
      hotel. The show window of plate glass now displayed the splintery rear
      panels of old Mr Boice's rolltop desk, that was heaped, on top, with back
      numbers of the <i>Voice</i>, the <i>Inter Ocean</i> and the <i>Congressional
      Record</i>, and a pile of inky zinc etchings mounted on wood blocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, back of a railing, were Humphrey Weaver's desk and Henry
      Calverly's table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey was tall, rather thin and angular, with a long face, long nose,
      long chin, swarthy complexion, and quick, quizzical brown eyes with
      innumerable fine wrinkles about them. When he smiled, his whole face
      seemed to wrinkle back, displaying many large teeth in a cavernous mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey might have been twenty-five or six. He was a reticent young man,
      with no girl or women friends that one ever saw, a fondness for the old
      corn-cob that he was always scraping, filling, or smoking, and a secret
      passion for the lesser known laws of physics. He lived alone, in a barn
      back of the old Parmenter place. He had divided the upper story into
      living and sleeping rooms, and put in hardwood floors and simple furniture
      and a piano. Downstairs, in what he called his shop, were lathes, a
      workbench, innumerable wood-and-metal working tools, a dozen or more of
      heavy metal wheels set, at right angles, in circular frames, and several
      odd little round machines suspended from the ceiling at the ends of
      twisted cords. In one corner stood a number of box kites, very large ones.
      And there were large planes of silk on spruce frames. He was an alumnus of
      the local university, but had made few friends, and had never been known
      in the town. Henry hadn't heard of him before the previous year, when he
      had taken the desk in the <i>Voice</i> office.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, Hen,'&mdash;Henry looked up from his copy paper&mdash;; 'Mrs
      Henderson looked in a few minutes ago, and left a programme and a list of
      guests for her show to-night. She wants to be sure and have you there. You
      can do it, can't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded listlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seems there's to be a contralto, too&mdash;somebody that's visiting
      her. She&mdash;Sister Henderson&mdash;appears to take you rather
      seriously, my boy. Wants you particularly to hear the new girl. One
      Corinne Doag. We,'&mdash;Humphrey smoked meditatively, then finished his
      sentence&mdash;'we talked you over, the lady and I. I promised you'd
      come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, the editorial staff of two lunched at Stanley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wha'd you and Mrs Henderson say about me?' asked Henry, over the pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She says,' remarked Humphrey, the wrinkles multiplying about his eyes,
      'that you have temperament. She thinks it's a shame.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's a shame?' muttered Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whatever has happened to you. I told her you were the steadiest boy I
      ever knew. Don't drink, smoke, or flirt. I didn't add that you enter every
      cent you spend in that little red book; but I've seen you doing it and
      been impressed. But I mentioned that you're the most conscientious
      reporter I ever saw. That started her. It seems that you're nothing of the
      sort. My boy, she set you before me in a new light. You begin to appear
      complex and interesting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still muttering, Henry said, 'Nothing so very interesting about me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It seems that you put on an opera here&mdash;directed it, or sang it, or
      something. Before my time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was <i>Iolanthe</i>,' said Henry, with a momentarily complacent
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you sang&mdash;all over the place, apparently. Why don't you sing
      now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's too,'&mdash;Henry was mumbling, flushing, and groping for a word&mdash;'too
      physical.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with a sudden movement that gave Humphrey a little start, the boy
      leaned over the table, pulled at his moustache, and asked, gloomily:
      'Listen! Do you think a man can change his nature?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey considered this without a smile. 'I don't see exactly how, Hen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean if he's been heedless and reckless&mdash;oh, you know, girls,
      debts, everything. Just crazy, sorta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I suppose a man can reform. Were you a very bad lot?' The wrinkled
      smile was reassuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That depends on what you&mdash;I wasn't exactly sporty, but&mdash;oh, you
      don't know the trouble I've had, Humphrey. Then my mother died, and I
      hadn't been half-decent to her, and I was left alone, and my uncle had to
      pay my debts out of the principal&mdash;it was hundreds of dollars&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice died out.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an element of pathos in the picture before him that Humphrey
      recognised with some sympathy&mdash;the gloomy lad of twenty, with that
      absurd little moustache that he couldn't let alone. After all, he <i>had</i>
      been rather put to it. It began to appear that he had suppressed himself
      without mercy. There would doubtless be reactions. Perhaps explosions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry went on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know what's happened to me. I don't feel right about things. I'&mdash;he
      hesitated, glanced up, then down, and his ears reddened&mdash;'I've been
      going with Martha Caldwell, you know. For a long time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mondays and Thursdays I go over there, and other times. I don't seem to
      want to go any more. But I get mixed up about it. I&mdash;I don't want
      them to say I'm fickle. They used to say it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You've evidently got gifts,' observed Humphrey, as if thinking aloud.
      'You've got some fire in you. The trouble with you now, of course, is that
      you're stale.' Humphrey deliberately considered the situation, then
      remarked: 'You asked me if a man can change his nature. I begin to see
      now. You've been trying to do that to yourself, for quite a while.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I suppose you'll find that you can't do it. Not quite that. The
      fire that's in you isn't going to stop burning just because you tell it
      to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what's a fellow to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. Just stick along, I suppose, gradually build up experience
      until you find work you can let yourself go in. Some way, of course,
      you've got to let yourself go, sooner or later.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, his eyes nervously alert now, his slim young body tense, was
      drawing jerkily with his fork on the coarse table-cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' he broke out, with the huskiness in his voice that came when his
      emotions pressed&mdash;'yes, but what if you can't let yourself go without
      letting everything go? What if the fire bums you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey found it difficult to frame a reply. He got no further, this as
      they were leaving the restaurant, than to say, 'Of course, one man can't
      advise another.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      As they were turning into the <i>Voice</i> office, Henry caught sight of
      Mamie Wilcox, in a cheap pink dress and flapping pink-and-white hat,
      loitering by the hotel. He fell back behind Humphrey. Mamie beckoned with
      her head. He nodded, and entered the office; and she moved slowly on
      around the corner of the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mumbled a rather unnecessary excuse to Humphrey, and slipped out,
      catching up with her on the avenue. She was unpleasantly attractive. She
      excited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' he asked, walking with her. 'Did you want to speak to me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stuck up, aren't we!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She pouted. 'Take a little walk with me. I do want to talk with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Haven't time. Got to get right back to the office.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;listen, meet me to-night. I can get out by eight. It's pretty
      important. Maybe serious.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it&mdash;-did anybody&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded. 'Mrs MacPherson. She was right in her door when I came out of
      your room.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did she say anything?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She looked a lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, say&mdash;I'll see you for a few minutes to-night. Say about
      eight.' This was best. It would be dark, or near it. He simply mustn't be
      seen strolling with Mamie Wilcox along Filbert Avenue in broad daylight.
      'What do you say to Douglass Street and the Lake Shore Drive?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Tell you what&mdash;bring a tandem along and take me for a
      ride.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I can't.' But his will was weak. 'Got to report a concert. I don't
      know, though. I s'pose I could get around at half-past nine' or ten and
      hear the last numbers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had often done this. Besides, he could probably manage it earlier. He
      knew he could rent a tandem at Murphy's cigar store down by the tracks. A
      quite wild, wholly fascinating stir of adventure was warming his breast
      and bringing that huskiness into his voice. He was letting go. He felt
      daring and a little mad. He hadn't realised, before to-day, that Mamie had
      such a lure about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before returning to the office he got his bank-book and brazenly drew from
      the bank, savings department, his entire account, amounting to ten dollars
      forty-six cents. He also bespoke the tandem.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the great days of bicycling. The first highwheeled, rattling
      horseless carriage was not to appear in the streets of Sunbury for a year
      or two yet. Bicycle clubs flourished. Memorial Day each year (they called
      it Decoration Day) was a mad rush of excursion and road races. Every
      Sunday witnessed a haggard-eyed humpbacked horde of 'Scorchers' in
      knickerbockers or woollen tights. Many of the young men one met on train
      and street wore medals with a suspended chain of gold bars, one for each
      'century run.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And these were the first great days of the bloomer girl. She was legion.
      Sometimes her bloomers were bloomers, sometimes they were knickerbockers,
      sometimes little more than the tights of the racing breed. She was dusty,
      sweaty, loud. She was never the sort of girl you knew; but always appeared
      from the swarming, dingy back districts of the city. Sometimes she rode a
      single wheel, sometimes tandem with some male of the humpbacked breed and
      of the heavily muscled legs and the grotesquely curved handle bars. The
      bloomer girl was looked at askance by the well-bred folk of the shaded
      suburbs. Ministers thumped pulpits and harangued half-empty pews regarding
      this final moral, racial disaster while she rode dustily by the very
      doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, as he pedalled the long machine through back streets to the
      rendezvous, was glad that the twilight was falling fast. In his breast
      pocket were copy paper and pencils, in an outer pocket his little
      olive-green book. His white trousers were caught about the ankles with
      steel dips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie kept him waiting. He hid both himself and the wheel in the shadows
      of the tall lilac bushes in the little village park.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came at length, said 'Hello!' and with a little deft unhooking, coolly
      stepped out of her skirt, rolled up that garment, thrust it under a bush,
      and stood before him in the sort of wheeling costume rarely seen in
      Sunbury save on Saturdays and Sundays when the Chicago crowds were pouring
      through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood motionless, silent, in the dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said she, smartly, 'are we riding?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a word he wheeled out the bicycle and they rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very close, there before him. She bent over the handle bars like
      an old-timer, and pedalled with something more than the abandon of a boy.
      It was going to be hard to talk to her... If he could only blot this day
      out of his life. 'She started it,' he thought fiercely, staring out ahead
      over her rhythmically moving shoulder. 'I never asked her to come in!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I didn't know you rode a wheel,' said he, after a time, dismally.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ride Sundays with the boys from Pennyweather Point. But you needn't
      tell that at home.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not telling anything at home,' muttered Henry. Then she flung back at
      him the one word.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Surprised?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;why, sorta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You thought I was satisfied to do the room work and wash dishes, I
      suppose!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know as I thought anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter, anyway? Scared at my bloomers?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what you call'em, is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must say you're grand company.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They pedalled past the university buildings, the athletic field, the
      lighthouse, up a grade between groves of oak, out along the brink of a
      clay bluff overlooking the steely dark lake&mdash;horizonless, still, a
      light or two twinkling far out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall we go to Hoffman's?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't care where we go,' said he.
    </p>

      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>The Weekly Voice of Sunbury</i> was put to press every Friday evening,
      was printed during that night, and appeared in the first mail on Saturday
      mornings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday, therefore, was the one distractingly busy day for Humphrey Weaver.
      And it was natural enough that he should snatch at Henry's pencilled
      report of the musicale at Mrs Henderson's with the briefest word of
      greeting, and give his whole mind, blue copy-editing pencil posed in air,
      to reading it. But he did note that the boy looked rather haggard, as if
      he hadn't slept much. He heard his mumbled remark that he had been over at
      the public library, writing the thing; and perhaps wondered mildly and
      momentarily why the boy should be writing at the library and not at home,
      and why he should speak of the fact at all. And now and again during the
      day he was aware of Henry, pale, dog-eyed, inclined to hang about as if
      confidences were trembling on his tongue. And he was carrying a little
      olive-green book around; drew it from his pocket every now and then and
      read or turned the pages with an ostentatious air of concentration, as if
      he wanted to be noticed. Humphrey decided to ask him what the trouble was;
      later, when the paper was put away. When he might have spoken, old man
      Boice was there, at his desk. And Humphrey never got out to meals on
      Fridays. Henry got all his work in on time: the 'Real Estate Notes' for
      the week and the last items for 'Along Simpson Street.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The report of the musicale would have brought a smile or two on another
      day. There was nearly a column of it. Henry had apparently been deeply
      moved by the singing of Anne Mayer Stelton. He dwelt on the 'velvet
      suavity' of her legato passages, her firmness of attack and the 'delicate
      lace work of her colourature.' 'Mme. Stelton's art,' he wrote, 'has
      deepened and broadened appreciably since she last appeared in Sunbury.
      Always gifted with a splendid singing organ, always charming in
      personality and profoundly rhythmically musical in temperament, she now
      has added a superstructure of technical authority, which gives to each
      passage, whether bravura or pianissimo, a quality and distinction seldom
      heard in this country. Miss Corinne Doag also added immeasurably to the
      pleasure of the select audience by singing a group of songs. Miss Corinne
      Doag has a contralto voice of fine <i>verve</i> and <i>timbre</i>. She is
      a guest of Mrs Henderson, who herself accompanied delightfully. Among
      those present were:&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's writing always startled you a little. Words fairly flowed through
      his pencil, long words, striking words. He had the word sense; this when
      writing. In speech he remained just about where he had been all through
      his teens, loose of diction, slurring and eliding and using slang as did
      most of the Middle-Westerners among whom he had always lived, and, like
      them, swallowing his tongue down his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey initialed the copy, tossed it into the devil's basket, turned to
      a pile of proofs, paused as if recollecting something, picked up the copy
      again, glanced rapidly through it, and turned on his assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here, Hen,' he remarked, 'you don't tell what they sang, either of
      'em. Or who <i>were</i> among those present.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was reading his little book at the moment, and fumbling at his
      moustache. A mournful object.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned now, with a start, and stared, wide-eyed, at Humphrey. His lips
      parted, but he didn't speak. A touch of colour appeared in his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as abruptly, he went limp in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I thought she left a list here and a programme,' he said, eyes now on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's practised eye ran swiftly over the double row of pigeonholes
      before him. 'Right you are!' he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a quarter past eleven that night when Humphrey scrawled his last
      'O.K.'; stretched out his long form in his swivel chair; yawned; said,
      'Well, <i>that's</i> done, thank God!'; and hummed and tapped out on his
      bare desk the refrain of a current song:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      'But you'd look sweet
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      On the seat
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Of a bicycle built for two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on Henry with a wrinkly, comfortable grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, my boy, it's too late for Stanley's but what do you say to a bite
      at Ericson's, over by the tracks?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he became fully aware of the woebegone look of the boy, fiddling
      eternally with that moustache, fingering the leaves of his little book,
      and added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'What on earth is the matter with you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry gazed long at his book, swallowed, and said weakly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm in trouble, Humphrey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, come, not so bad as all&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silenced by the sudden plaintive appeal on Henry's face. Mr Boice,
      a huge-slow-moving figure of a man with great white whiskers, was coming
      in from the press room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked down to the little place by the tracks. Humphrey had a
      roast-beef sandwich and coffee; Henry gloomily devoured two cream puffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Humphrey drew out something of the story. It was difficult at first.
      Henry could babble forth his most sacred inner feelings with an ingenuous
      volubility that would alarm a naturally reticent man, and he could be
      bafflingly secretive. To-night he was both, and neither. He was full of
      odd little spiritual turnings and twistings&mdash;vague as to the clock,
      intent on justifying himself, submerged in a boundless bottomless sea of
      self-pity. Humphrey, touched, even worried, finally went at him with
      direct questions, and managed to piece out the incident of the Thursday
      morning in the boy's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I never asked her in,' he hurried to explain. 'She came in. Maybe
      after that it was my fault, but I didn't ask her in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But as far as I can see, Hen, it wasn't so serious. You didn't make love
      to her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tried to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes. She doubtless expected that. But she got away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But don't you see, Hump, Mrs MacPherson saw her coming out. She'd been
      snooping. Musta heard some of it. That's why Mamie hung around for me
      yesterday noon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, she hung around?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry swallowed, and nodded. 'That's why I slipped out again after lunch
      yesterday. I didn't want to tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Naturally. A man's little flirtations&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But wait, Hump! She was excited about it. And she seemed to think it was
      up to me, somehow. I couldn't get rid of her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, of course&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She made me promise to see her last night&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;wait a minute!&mdash;last night&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This was the first part of the evening. She made me promise to rent
      Murphy's tandem&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm! you <i>were</i> going it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And we rode up the shore a ways.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you didn't hear all of the musicale?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. She wanted to go up to Hoffmann's Garden. So we went there&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But good lord, that's six miles&mdash;-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Eight. You can do it pretty fast with a tandem. The place was jammed. I
      felt just sick about it. The waiter made us walk clear through, past all
      the tables. I coulda died. You see, Mamie, she&mdash;but I had to be a
      sport, sorta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you had to go through with it, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure! I <i>had</i> to. It was awful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anybody there that knew you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's colour rose and rose. He gazed down intently at the remnant of a
      cream puff; pushed it about with his fork. Then his lips formed the word,
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey considered the problem. 'Well,' he finally observed, 'after all,
      what's the harm? It may embarrass you a little. But most fellows pick up a
      girl now and then. It isn't going to kill anybody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but'&mdash;Henry's emotions seemed to be all in his throat to-night;
      he swallowed&mdash;'but it&mdash;well, Martha was there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh&mdash;Martha Caldwell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. And Mary Ames and her mother. They were with Mr Merchant's party.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'James B., Junior?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. They drove up in a trap. I saw it outside. We weren't but three
      tables away from them. They saw everything. Mamie, she&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'After all, Hen. It's disturbing and all that, but you were getting pretty
      tired of Martha&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It isn't that, Hump 1 I don't know that I was. I get mixed. But it's the
      shame, the disgrace. The Ameses have been down on me anyway, for something
      that happened two years ago. And now...! And Martha, she's&mdash;well,
      can't you see, Hump? It's just as if there's no use of my trying to stay
      in this town any longer. They'll all be down on me now. They'll whisper
      about me. They're doing it now. I feel it when I walk up Simpson Street.
      They're going to mark me for that kind of fellow, and I'm not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His face sank into his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey considered him; said, 'Of course you're not;' considered him
      further. Then he said, reflectively: 'It's unpleasant, of course, but I'll
      confess I can't see that what you've told me justifies the words &ldquo;shame&rdquo;
       and &ldquo;disgrace.&rdquo; They're strong words, my boy. And as for leaving town...
      See here, Hen | Is there anything you haven't told me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The bowed head inclined a little farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hadn't you better tell me? Did anything happen afterward? Has the girl
      got&mdash;well, a real hold on you?' The head moved slowly sidewise. 'We
      fought afterward, all the way home. Rowed. Jawed at each other like a pair
      of little muckers. No, it isn't that. I hated her all the time. I told her
      I was through with her. She tried to catch me in the hall this morning, up
      on the third floor. Came sneaking to my room again. With towels. That's
      why I wrote in the library.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you aren't telling me what the rest of it was.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She&mdash;oh, she drank beer, and&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what most everybody does at Hoffmann's. The beer's good there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. I don't like the stuff.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come, Hen, tell me. Or drop it. Either.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you. But I get so mad. It's&mdash;she&mdash;well, she wore
      pants.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's sympathy and interest were real, and he did not smile as he
      queried: 'Bloomers?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, pants. Britches. I never saw anything so tight. Nothing else like 'em
      in the whole place. People nudged each other and laughed and said things,
      right out loud. Hump, it was terrible. And we walked clear through&mdash;past
      hundreds of tables&mdash;and away over in the corner&mdash;and there were
      the Ameses, and Martha, and&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      His head was up now; there was fire in his eyes; his voice trembled with
      the passion of a profound moral indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump, she's tough. She rides with that crowd from Pennyweather Point. She
      smokes cigarettes. She&mdash;she leads a double life.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And neither did it occur to Humphrey, looking at the blazing youth before
      him, to smile at that last remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey had reached a point of real concern over Henry. He thought about
      him the last thing that night&mdash;pictured him living a lonely,
      spasmodically ascetic life, in the not over cheerful boarding-house of Mrs
      Wilcox&mdash;and the first thing the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curious revelation of the later morning nettled him, perhaps, as a
      responsible editor, but, if anything, deepened his concern. He had the boy
      on his conscience, that was the size of it. He thought him over all the
      morning, before and after the revelation. After it he smoked steadily and
      hard, and knit his brows, and shook his head gravely, and chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry always came in between half-past eleven and twelve Saturdays to clip
      his contributions from the paper and paste them, end to end, in a
      'string.' Then Humphrey would measure the string with a two-foot rule and
      fill out an order on the <i>Voice</i> Company for payment at the rate of a
      dollar and a quarter a column, or something less than seven cents an inch.
      Henry despairing of a raise from nine dollars a week had, months back,
      elected to work 'on space.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That the result had not been altogether happy&mdash;he was averaging
      something less than nine dollars a week now&mdash;does not concern us
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey contrived to keep busy until the string was made and measured;
      then proposed lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Stanley's, the food ordered, he leaned on his lank elbows and surveyed
      the dejected young man before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen,' he remarked dryly, 'do you really think Anne Mayer Stelton's voice
      has a velvet suavity?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry glanced up from his barley soup, coloured perceptibly, then dropped
      his eyes and consumed several spoonfuls of the tepid fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not?' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You feel, do you, that her art has deepened and broadened appreciably
      since she last appeared in Sunbury?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry centred all his attention on the soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You feel that she has really added a superstructure of technique during
      her study abroad?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's ears were scarlet now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey, his soup turning cold between his elbows, looked steadily at his
      deeply unhappy friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment longer Henry went on eating. But then he quietly laid down
      his spoon, sank rather limply back in his chair, and wanly met Humphrey's
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was a moment this morning, Hen, when I could have wrung your neck.
      A moment.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's voice was colourless. His expression was that of a man who has
      absorbed his maximum of punishment, to whom nothing more matters much.
      'What is it?' he asked. 'What happened?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Madame Stelton fell in the Chicago station, hurrying for the train, and
      sprained her ankle. Miss Doag gave the entire programme.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sat a little time considering this. Finally he raised his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump,' he said, 'I don't know that I'm sorry. I'm rather glad you caught
      me, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a difficult speech to meet. Humphrey even found it a moving speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had an unlucky day,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded. The roast beef and potato were before them now; but Henry
      pushed his aside. He ate nothing more.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mrs Henderson was in,' Humphrey added. 'I don't care what they say about
      her, she's a really pretty woman and bright as all get out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was she mad, Hump?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;well, yes, I gathered the impression that you'd better not try to
      talk to her for a while. There she was, you see&mdash;came straight down
      to the office or stopped on her way to the train. Had Miss Doag along.
      Unusual dark brown eyes&mdash;almost black. A striking girl. But you won't
      meet her&mdash;not this trip. Though she couldn't help laughing once or
      twice. Over your phrases. You see you laid it on unnecessarily thick. <i>Verve.
      Timbre</i>. It puts you&mdash;I won't say in a Bad light&mdash;but
      certainly in a rather absurd light.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' said Henry, gently, meekly, 'it does. It sorta completes the thing.
      I picked up some of the town talk this morning. They're laughing at me.
      And Martha cut me dead, not an hour ago. I've lost my friends. I'm sort of
      an outcast, I suppose. A&mdash;a pariah.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd better eat some food,' said Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't.' Henry was brooding, a tired droop to his mouth, a look of
      strain about the eyes. He began thinking aloud, rather aimlessly. 'It
      ain't as if I did that sort of thing. I never asked her to come in. I
      couldn't very well refuse to talk with her. She suggested the tandem. It
      did seem like a good idea to get her out of town, if I had to risk being
      seen with her. I'll admit I got mixed&mdash;awfully. I don't suppose I
      knew just what I was doing. But it was the first time in two years. Hump,
      you don't know how hard I've&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the first-time offenders that get most awfully caught,' observed
      Humphrey. 'But never mind that now. You're caught, Hen. No good
      explaining. You've just got to live it down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what I've been doing for two years&mdash;living things down. And
      look where it's brought me. I'm worse off than ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a slight quivering in his voice that conveyed an ominous
      suggestion to Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mustn't let the kid sink this way,' he thought. Then, aloud: 'Here's a
      little plan I want to suggest, Hen. You're stale. You're taking this too
      hard. You need a change.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like to leave town, exactly, Hump&mdash;as if I was licked. I've
      changed about that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're not going to leave town. You're coming over to live with me. Move
      this afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry seemed to find difficulty in comprehending this. Humphrey, suddenly
      a victim of emotion, pressed on, talking fast. 'I'll be through by four.
      You be packing up. Get an expressman and fetch your things. Here's my key.
      I'll let you pay something. We'll get our breakfasts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to stop. It struck him as silly, letting this forlorn youth touch
      him so deeply. He gulped down a glass of water. 'Come on,' he said
      brusquely, 'let's get out.' And on the street he added, avoiding those
      bewildered dog eyes&mdash;'I'm going to reshuffle you and deal you out
      fresh.' That's all you need, a new deal.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But to himself he added: 'It won't be easy. He is taking it hard. He's
      unstrung. I'll have to work it out slowly, head him around, build up his
      confidence. Teach him to laugh again. It'll take time, but it can be done.
      He's good material. Get him out of that dam boardinghouse to start with.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      7
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was nearly five o'clock when Humphrey reached his barn at the rear of
      the Parmenter place. He found the outside door ajar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen's here now,' he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped within the dim shop, that had once been a carriage room,
      called, 'Hello there!' and crossed to the narrow stairway. There was no
      answer. He went on up.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the rug in the centre of the living-room floor was a heap consisting of
      an old trunk, a suit-case, a guitar in an old green woollen bag, two
      canes, an umbrella, and various loose objects&mdash;books, a small stand
      of shelves, two overcoats, hats, and a wire rack full of photographs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The polished oak post at the head of the stairs was chipped, where they
      had pushed the trunk around. Humphrey fingered the spot; found the
      splinter on the floor; muttered, 'I'll glue it on, and rub over the
      cracks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked again at the disorderly heap in the centre of the room. 'It
      didn't occur to him to stow'em away,' he mused. 'Probably didn't know
      where to put 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He set to work, hauling the trunk into a little unfinished room next to
      his own bedroom. He had meant to make a kitchen of this some day. He
      carried in the other things; then got a dust-pan and brushed off the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rooms were clean and tidy. Humphrey was a born bachelor; he had the
      knack of living, alone in comfort. His books occupied all one wall of his
      bedroom, handy for night reading. He had running water there, and electric
      lights placed conveniently by the books, beside his mirror, and at the
      head of his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood now in the living-room, humming softly and looking around with
      knit brows. After a few moments he stopped humming. He was struggling
      against a slight but definite depression. He had known it would be hard to
      give up room in his comfortable quarters to another; he had not known it
      would be as hard as it was now plainly to be. He started humming again,
      and moved about, straightening the furniture. This oddly pleasant home was
      his citadel. He had himself evolved it, in every detail, from a dusty,
      cobwebby old bam interior. He had run the wires and installed the water
      pipes and fixtures with his own hands. He seldom even asked his
      acquaintances in. There seemed no strong reason why he should do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen shouldn't have left the door open like that,' he mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his hands into his pockets and whistled a little. Then he
      sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he thought, 'needn't be a hog. It's my chance to do a fairly
      decent turn. The boy hasn't a soul. Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He isn't the sort you can safely leave by himself. Got to be organised.
      Very likely I've got to build him over from the ground up. Might try
      making him read history. God knows he needs background. It'll take time.
      And patience. All I've got. Help him, little by little, to get hold of his
      self-esteem. Teach the kid to laugh again. That's it. I've taken it on.
      Can't quit. It seems to be my job.' And he sighed again. 'Have to get him
      a key of his own.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There were footsteps below. Henry, his arms full of personal treasures and
      garments he had overlooked in packing, came slowly up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I put your things in there,' Humphrey pointed. 'We'll move the box couch
      in for you to-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That'll be fine,' said Henry, aimless of eye, weak of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's eyes followed him as he passed into the improvised bedroom; and
      he compressed his lips and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly Henry came out and sank mournfully on a chair. It was time for the
      first lesson. 'There's simply no life in the boy,' thought Humphrey. He
      cleared his throat, and said aloud:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell you what, Hen. We'll celebrate a little, this first evening. I've
      got a couple of chafing dishes and some odds and ends of food. And I make
      excellent drip coffee. If you'll go over to Berger's and get a pound or so
      of cheese for the rabbit, I'll look the situation over and figure out a
      meal. Charge it to me. I have an account there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, without change of expression, got slowly up, said, 'All right,'
      hung around for a little time, wandering about the room, and finally
      wandered off down the stairs and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned at twenty minutes past midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey was abed, reading Smith' on Torsion. He put down the book and
      waited. He had left lights on downstairs and in the living-room. Since six
      o'clock he had passed through many and extreme states of feeling; at
      present he was in a state of suspense between worry and strongly
      suppressed wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry came into the room&mdash;a little flushed, bright of eye, the
      sensitive corners of his mouth twitching nervously, alertly, happily
      upward. He even actually chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, where&mdash;on&mdash;earth....
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry waved a light hand. 'Queerest thing happened. But say, I guess I owe
      you an apology, sorta. I ought to have sent word or something. Everything
      happened so quickly. You know how it is. When you're sorta swept off your
      feet like that&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like what!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh&mdash;well, it was like this. I went over to get the cheese.... Funny,
      it doesn't seem as if it could have been to-day! Seems as if it was weeks
      ago that I moved my things over.' His eyes roved about the room; lingered
      on the books; followed out the details of the neat surface wiring with
      sudden interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go on!' From Humphrey, this, with grim emphasis that was wholly lost on
      the self-absorbed youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes! Well, you see, I went over to Berger's and got the cheese; and
      just as I was coming out I ran into Mrs Henderson and Corinne.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Corinne Doag. You know. She's visiting there. Well, sir, I could have
      died right there. Fussed me so I turned around and was going back into the
      store. I was just plain rattled. And you were right about Mrs Henderson.
      She was kinda mad. She made me stand right up and take a scolding. Shook
      her finger at me right, there in front of Berger's. That fussed me worse.
      Gee! I was red all over. But you see it sorta fussed Corinne Doag too&mdash;she
      was standing right there&mdash;and she got a little red. Wasn't it a
      scene, though! Sorta made us acquainted right off. You know, threw us
      together. Then she&mdash;Mrs Henderson&mdash;said I didn't deserve to meet
      a girl with verve and timbre, but just to show she wasn't the kind to
      harbour angry feelings she'd introduce us. And&mdash;and&mdash;I walked
      along home with'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking again at the solid ranks of books that extended, floor to
      ceiling, across the end wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say, Hump, you don't mean to say you really read all those!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You walked home with them. Go on.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, well, they asked me to stay to supper, and I did, and some folks came
      in, and we sang and things, and then we&mdash;oh, yes, how much was the
      cheese?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How in thunder do I know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;there was a pound of it&mdash;Mrs Henderson made a rabbit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The none too subtle chill in the atmosphere about Humphrey seemed at last
      to be meeting and somewhat subduing the exuberant good cheer that radiated
      from Henry. He fell to fingering his moustache, and studying the
      bed-posts. Once or twice, he looked up, hesitated on the brink of speech,
      only to lower his eyes again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, unexpectedly, he chuckled aloud, and said, 'She's a wonderful girl.
      At first she seems quiet, but when you get to know her... going to take a
      walk with me to-morrow morning. She was going to church with Mrs H., but I
      told her we'd worship in God's great outdoor temple.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He yawned now. And stretched, deliberately, luxuriously like a healthy
      animal, his arms above his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said he, 'it's late as all get out. I suppose you want to go to
      sleep.' He got as far as the door, then leaned confidingly against the
      wall. 'Look here, Hump, I don't want you to think I don't appreciate your
      taking me in like this. It's dam nice of you. Don't know what I'd have
      done if it wasn't for you. Well, good-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He got part way out the door this time; then, brushed by a wave of his
      earlier moody self-consciousness, turned back. He even came in and leaned
      over the foot of the bed, and flushed a little. It occurred to Humphrey
      that the boy appeared to be momentarily ashamed of his present happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know what was the matter with me?' he broke out. 'It was just what
      you said. I was taking things too hard. The great thing is to be rational,
      normal. Thing with me was I used to go to one extreme and now these last
      two years I've been going with all my might to the other. Of course it
      wouldn't work... Do you know who's helped me a whole lot? You'd never
      guess.' Rather shamefaced, he drew from his pocket a little book bound in
      olive-green 'ooze' leather. 'It's this old fellow. Epictetus. Listen to
      what he says&mdash;&ldquo;To the rational animal only is the irrational
      intolerable.&rdquo; That was the trouble with me. I just wasn't a rational
      animal. I <i>wasn't</i>... Well, I've got to say good-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey heard him getting out of his clothes and into the bed that
      Humphrey himself had made up on the box couch. It seemed only a moment
      later that he was snoring&mdash;softly, slowly, comfortably, like a
      rational animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The minute hand of the alarm clock on Humphrey's bureau crept up to
      twelve, the hour hand to one. Then came a single resonant, reverberating
      boom from the big clock up at the university.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, lips compressed, Humphrey got up, and in his pyjamas and slippers
      went downstairs and switched off the door light he found burning there.
      The stair light could be turned off upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, instead of going up, he opened the door and stood looking out on the
      calm village night.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of all the&mdash;&mdash;' he muttered inconclusively. 'Why it's&mdash;he's
      a&mdash;&mdash; Good God! It's the limit! It's&mdash;it's intolerable.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The word, floating from his own lips, caught his ear. His frown began,
      very slowly, to relax. A dry, grudging smile wrinkled its way across his
      mobile face. And he nodded, deliberately. 'Epictetus,' he remarked, 'was
      right.'

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was half-past
      nine of a Sabbath morning at the beginning of June. The beneficent
      sunshine streamed down on the dark-like streets, on the shingled roofs of
      the many decorous but comfortable homes, on the wide lawns, on the
      hundreds of washed and brushed little boys and starched little girls that
      were marching meekly to the various Sunday schools, Presbyterian,
      Methodist, Episcopal, Congregational, Baptist. Above the new cement
      sidewalk on Simpson Street&mdash;where all the stores were closed except
      two drug stores and Swanson's flower shop&mdash;the sunshine quivered and
      wavered, bringing oppressive promise of the first really warm day of the
      young summer. Slow-swinging church bells sent out widening, reverberating
      circles of mellow tone through the still air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun shone too on the old barn back of the Parmenter place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The barn presented an odd appearance; the red paint of an earlier decade
      in the nineteenth century here faded to brown, there flaked off
      altogether, but the upstairs part, once the haymow, embellished with neat
      double windows. Below, giving on the alley, was a white-painted door with
      a single step and an ornamental boot scraper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within, in Humphrey's room, the bed was neatly made, clothes hung in a
      corner, shoes and slippers stood in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Henry's room the couch bed was a rumpled heap, a suit-case lay on the
      floor half-unpacked, a trunk was in the same condition, clothes, shoes,
      neckties, photographs were scattered about on table, chairs and floor, a
      box of books by the bed, the guitar in its old green woollen bag leaning
      against the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a corner of the living-room the doors of an ingeniously contrived
      cupboard stood open, disclosing a sink, shelves of dishes, and a small
      ice-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey, in shirt, trousers and slippers, stood washing the breakfast
      things. He was smoking his cob pipe. His long, wrinkly, usually quizzical
      face, could Henry have seen it, was deathly sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, however, could see only the lean back. And he looked at that only
      momentarily. He was busy smoothing the fringe along his upper lip and
      twisting it up at the ends. Too, he leaned slightly on his bamboo walking
      stick, staring down at it, watching it bend. Despite his white ducks and
      shoes, serge coat, creamy white felt hat on the back of his shapely head,
      despite the rather noticeable nose glasses with the black silk cord
      hanging from them to his lapel, he presented a forlorn picture. He wished
      Humphrey would say something. That long back was hostile. Henry was
      helpless before hostility, as before logic. Already they weren't getting
      on. Little things like washing dishes and making beds and&mdash;dusting!
      Humphrey was proving an old fuss-budget. And Henry couldn't think what to
      do about it. He could never:&mdash;never in the world&mdash;do those fussy
      things, use his hands. He couldn't even flounder through the little mental
      processes that lead up to doing things with your hands. He wasn't that
      sort of person. Humphrey was.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, thunder&mdash;Hump!' Thus Henry, weakly. 'Let the old dishes slide a
      little while. I'll be back. It ain't my fault that I've got a date now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey set down a cup rather hard, rolled the dish-towel into a ball and
      threw it, with heat, after the cup, then strode to the window, nursing his
      pipe and staring out at the gooseberry and currant bushes in the back yard
      of the First Presbyterian parsonage across the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey liked order. It was the breath of his life. Combined with
      solitude it spelled peace to his bachelor soul. But here it was only the
      second day and the place was a pigsty. What would it be in a week!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware that Henry moved over, all hesitation, and with words, to
      shut the door of that hopelessly littered bedroom. The boy appeared to
      have no intention of picking up his things; he wasn't even unpacking!
      Leaving his clothes that way 1... The words he was so confusedly uttering
      were the absurdest excuses: 'Just shut the door&mdash;fix it all up when I
      get back&mdash;an hour or so...
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in a wave of unaccustomed sentimentalism that Humphrey had gathered
      him in. Humphrey had few visitors. You couldn't work with aimless youths
      hanging around. He knew all about that. Humphrey's evenings were precious.
      His time was figured out, Monday morning to Saturday night, to the minute.
      And the Sundays were always an orgy of work. But this youth, to whom he
      had opened his quarters and his slightly acid heart, was the most aimless
      being he had ever known. An utter surprise; a shock. Yet here he was, all
      over the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey was trying, by a mighty effort of will, to get himself back into
      that maudlin state of pity which had brought on all this trouble. If he
      could only manage again to feel sorry for the boy, perhaps he could stand
      him. But he could only bite his pipe-stem. He was afraid he might say
      something he would be sorry for. No good in that, of course.... No more
      peaceful study, all alone, propped up in bed, with a pipe and reading
      light! No more wonderful nights in the shop downstairs! No more holding to
      a delicately fresh line of thought&mdash;balancing along like a
      wire-walker over a street! The boy was over by the stairs now, all
      apologies, mumbling useless words. But he was going&mdash;no doubt
      whatever as to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm late now,' he was saying.'What else can I do, Hump? I promised.
      She'll be looking for me now. If you just wouldn't be in such a thundering
      hurry about those darn dishes... I can't live like a machine. I just
      can't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You could have cleaned up your room while you've been standing there,'
      said Humphrey, in a rumbling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I couldn't! Put up all my pictures and books and things! I'm not like
      you. You don't understand!' Humphrey wheeled on him, pipe in hand, a cold
      light in his eyes, a none-too-agreeable smile wrinkling the lower part of
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not asking much of you,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, thunder, Hump! Do you think I don't appreciate&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd be glad to help you. But you've got to do a <i>little</i> on your own
      account. For God's sake show some spine!' Sand-fly! Damn it, this is more
      than I can stand! It smothers me! How can I work! How can I think!' He
      stopped short; bit his lip; turned back to the window and thrust his pipe
      into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey knew without looking that the boy was fussing endlessly at that
      absurd moustache. And sighing&mdash;he heard that. He bit hard on his
      pipe-stem. The day was wrecked already. He would be boiling up every few
      moments; tripping over Henry's things; regretting his perhaps too harsh
      words. Yes, they were too harsh, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was muttering, mumbling, tracing out the pattern in the rug-border
      with his silly little stick. These words were audible:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't see why you asked me to come here. I suppose I... Of course, if
      you don't want me to stay here with you, I suppose I... Oh, well! I guess
      I ain't much good....'
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice trailed huskily off into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, there didn't seem to be any place the boy could stay, if not
      here. Living alone in a boarding-house hadn't worked at all. To send him
      out into the world would be like condemning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry moved off down the stairs, slowly, pausing once as if he had not yet
      actually determined to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking more briskly, he emerged from the alley and swung around into
      Filbert Avenue. The starched and shining children were pouring in an
      intermittent stream into the First Presbyterian chapel, behind the big
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gloom in his eyes, striking in a savage aimlessness with his cane at the
      grass, he passed the edifice. Walking thus, he felt a presence and lifted
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Approaching was a pleasant-looking young woman of twenty, of a good
      figure, a few girlish freckles across the bridge of her nose, abundant
      hair tucked in under her Sunday hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Martha Caldwell. She had a class in the Sunday-school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha saw him. No doubt about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment, in Henry's abasement of spirit, he half forgot that she
      had cut him dead, publicly, on Simpson Street on the Saturday. Or if it
      was not a forgetting it was a vagueness. Henry was full to brimming of
      himself. Not in years had he craved sympathy as he craved it to-day. The
      word 'craved,' though, isn't strong enough. It was an utter need. An
      outcast, perhaps literally homeless; for how could he go back to
      Humphrey's after what had occurred! He must pack his things, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hand&mdash;slowly, a thought stiffly&mdash;toward his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha moved swiftly by, staring past him, fixedly, her lips compressed,
      her colour rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's hand hung suspended a moment, then sank to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry himself was capable of any sort of heedlessness, but never of
      unkindness or of cutting a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour surged hotly over his face and reddened his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a chance&mdash;a pretty good chance, it seemed, as he recalled
      the pleasant Saturday evening over a rabbit&mdash;that he might find
      sympathy at Mrs Arthur V. Henderson's. That was one place, where, within
      twelve hours, Henry Calverley, 3rd, had had some standing. They had seemed
      to like him. Mrs Henderson had unquestionably played up to him. And her
      guest was a peach!
    </p>
    <p>
      At a feverish pace, almost running, he went there.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      Corinne Doag was a big girl with blue-black hair and a profile like the
      Goddess of Liberty on the silver quarter of the period. Her full face
      rather belied the profile; it was an easy, good-natured face, though with
      a hint of preoccupation about the dark eyes. Her smile was almost a grin.
      She had the great gift of health. She radiated it. You couldn't ignore her
      you felt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not a day older than Henry, Corinne was a singer of promise. At Mrs
      Henderson's musicale, she had managed groups of Schumann, Schubert, Franz
      and Wolff, an Italian aria or two and some quaint French folk songs with
      ample evidence of sound training and coaching. Her voice had faults. It
      was still a little too big for her. It was a contralto without a hollow
      note in it, firm and strong, with a good upper range. There was in it more
      than a hint of power. It moved you, even in her cruder moments. Her
      speaking voice&mdash;slow, lazy, strongly sensuous&mdash;gave Henry
      thrills.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Henry strolled up the lake, along the bluff through and beyond the
      oak-clad campus, away up past the lighthouse. She seemed not to mind the
      increasing heat. She had the careless vitality of a young mountain lion,
      and the grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry himself minded no external thing. Corinne Doag was, at the moment,
      the one person in the world who could help him in his hour of deep
      trouble. It was not clear how she could help him, but somehow she could.
      He was blindly sure of it. If he could just impress himself on her, make
      her forget other men, other interests! He had started well, the night
      before. Things had gone fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leading her to a secluded breakwater, between the lighthouse and
      Pennyweather Point, where, under the clay bluff, the shell of an old
      boat-house gave you a back as you sat on a gray timber and shielded you at
      once from morning sun and from the gaze of casual strollers up the beach.
      Henry knew the place well, had guided various girls there. Martha had
      often spoken of it as 'our' breakwater. But no twinge of memory disturbed
      him now. His nervous intentness on this immediate, rather desperate task
      of conquering Corinne's sympathy fully occupied his turbulent thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived at the spot he was stilted in manner, though atremble
      within. He ostentatiously took off his coat, spread it for her,
      overpowering her protests.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been thought by a number of girls and by a few of his elders that
      Henry had charm. He was aware of quality they called charm he could
      usually turn on and off like water at a faucet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, of all occasions, was the time to turn it on. But he was breathlessly
      unequal to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perversity seized his tongue. He had seen himself lying easily, not
      ungracefully beside her, saying (softly) the things she would most like to
      hear. Speak of her voice, of course. And sing with her (softly) while they
      idly watched the streaky, sparkling lake and the swooping, creaking gulls
      above it. But he did none of these. Instead he stood over her, glaring
      down rather fiercely, and saying nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The shade does feel good,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he groped for words, or for a mental attitude that might result in
      words. None came. Here she was, at his feet, and he couldn't even speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell back, in pertubation, on physical display, became the prancing
      male.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I like to skip stones,' he managed to say, with husky self-consciousness.
      He hunted flat stones; threw them hard and far, until his face shone with
      sweat and a damp spot appeared in his shirt between his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her, 'Better let me hold your glasses,' he responded with an irritable
      shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But such physical violence couldn't go on indefinitely. Not in this heat.
      He threw less vigorously. He wondered in something of a funk, why he
      couldn't grasp his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became aware of a sound. A sound that in a more felicitous moment would
      have thrilled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was singing, softly. Something French, apparently. Once she stopped,
      and did a phrase over, as if she were practising.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole a glance. She wasn't even looking at him. She had sunk back on an
      elbow, her long frame stretched comfortably out, and seemed to be
      observing the gulls, rather absently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry came over; sat on a spile; glared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I skipped that last one seven times,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him an indulgent little smile, and hummed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She doesn't know I'm here,' he mused, with bitterness. 'I don't count.
      Nobody wants me.' And added, 'She's selfish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he broke out, tragically: 'You don't know what I've been through.
      I wouldn't tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The tune came to an end. Still watching the gulls, still absently, she
      asked, after a pause, 'Why not?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd be like the others. You'd despise me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I doubt that. Mildred Henderson certainly doesn't. You ought to hear her
      talk about you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She'll be like the others too. My life has been very hard. Living alone
      with my way to make. Wha'd she say about me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That you're a genius. She can't make out why you've been burying
      yourself, working for a little country paper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry considered this. It was pleasing. But he might have wished for a
      less impersonal manner in Corinne. She kept following those gulls;
      speaking most casually, as if it was nothing or little to her what anybody
      thought about anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still&mdash;it was pleasing. He sat erect. A light glimmered in his eye;
      glimmered and grew. When he spoke, his voice took on body.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So she says I'm a genius, eh! Well, maybe it's true. Maybe I am. I'm
      something. Or there's something in me. Sometimes I feel it. I get all on
      fire with it. I've done a few things. I put on <i>Iolanthe</i> here. When
      I was only eighteen. Chorus of fifty, and big soloists. I ran it&mdash;drilled
      'em&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know. Mildred told me. Mildred really did say you were wonderful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll do something else one of these days.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure you will,' she murmured politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was going none too well. She wasn't really interested. He hadn't
      touched her. Perhaps he had better not talk about himself. He thought it
      over, and decided another avenue of approach would be better.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's an awfully pretty brooch,' he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced down; touched it with her long fingers. The brooch was a
      cameo, white on onyx, set in beaded old gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was a present,' she said. 'From one of the nicest men I ever knew.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This chilled Henry's heart. His own emotions were none too stable. Out of
      his first-hand experience he had been able at times, in youthfully
      masculine company, to expound general views regarding the sex that might
      be termed cynical. But confronted with the particular girl, the new girl,
      Henry was an incorrigible idealist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had only vaguely occurred to him that Corinne had men friends. It hurt,
      just to think of it. And presents&mdash;things like that, gold in it&mdash;the
      thing had cost many a penny! His bitterness swelled; blackened his
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's it,' these ran now. 'Presents! Money! That's what girls want. Keep
      you dancing. String you. Make you spend a lot on 'em. That's what they're
      after!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The situation was so painful that he got up abruptly and again skipped
      stones. Until the fact that she let him do it, amused herself practising
      songs and drinking in the beauty of the place and the day, became quite
      too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came gloomily over, she remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'We must be starting back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood motionless; even let her get up, with an amused expression throw
      his coat over her arm, and take a few steps along the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, come on, don't go yet,' he begged. 'Why, we've only just got here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a long walk. And it's hot. We'll never get back for dinner if we
      don't start. I mustn't keep Mildred waiting.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, 'A lot she'd care if she wanted to be with me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, 'What you doing to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, a couple of Chicago men are coming out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!' It was between a grunt and a snort. He struck out at such a gait
      that she finally said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you want to walk at that pace I'm afraid you'll have to walk alone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So far a failure. Just as with Humphrey, the situation had given him no
      opportunity to display his own kind of thing. The picturesque slang phrase
      had not then been coined; but Henry was in wrong and knew it. It was
      defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first faint hope stirred when Mrs Henderson rose from a hammock and
      came to the top step to clasp his hand. She thought him a genius. Well,
      she had been accompanist through all those rehearsals for <i>Iolanthe.</i>
      She ought to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked him now, in her alertly offhand way, to stay to dinner. He
      accepted instantly.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mildred Henderson was little, slim, quick, with tiny feet and hands.
      Despite these latter she was the most accomplished pianist in Sunbury. She
      had snappy little eyes, and a way of smiling quickly and brightly. The
      Hendersons had lived four or five years in Sunbury. They had no children.
      They had no servant at this time&mdash;but she possessed the gift of
      getting up pleasant little meals without apparent effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the arrival of Corinne and Henry she disappeared for a few moments,
      then called them to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's really a cold lunch,' she said, as they gathered at the table&mdash;'chicken
      and salad and things. But there's plenty for you, Henry. Do have some iced
      tea. I know they starve you at that old boarding-house. We've all had our
      little term at Mrs Wilcox's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;I'm not living there any more. I've moved.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not to Mrs Black's?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No... you see I work with Humphrey Weaver at the <i>Voice</i> office and
      he asked me to come and live with him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With him? And where does he live?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, just back of the old Parmenter place.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But there's nothing back of the Parmenter place!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes&mdash;you see, the barn&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not that old red&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. You'd be surprised! Humphrey's put in hardwood and electricity and
      things. He's really a wonderful person. Did the wiring himself. And the
      water pipes. You ought to see his books&mdash;and his shop downstairs.
      He's an inventor, you know. Going to be. Don't you think for a minute that
      he's just a country editor. That's just while he's feeling his way. Oh,
      Hump's a smart fellow. Mighty decent of him to take me in that way, too;
      because he's busy and I know he'd rather live alone. You see, he's quiet
      and orderly about things, and I&mdash;well, I'm different.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Offhand,' mused Mrs Henderson, 'I shouldn't suspect Humphrey Weaver of
      temperament. But tell me&mdash;how on earth do you live? Who cooks and
      cleans up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Hump gets breakfast and&mdash;and we'll probably take turns
      cleaning up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You remember Humphrey Weaver, Corinne,' the little hostess breezed on.
      'You've met him. Tall, thin, face wrinkles up when he smiles or speaks to
      you.' She added, as if musing aloud, 'He <i>has</i> nice eyes.' Then, to
      Henry:
    </p>
    <p>
      'But do you mean to say that so fascinating a man as that lives
      undiscovered, right under our noses, in this bourgeois town.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was rather vague about the meaning of 'bourgeois,' but he nodded
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must bring him down here, Henry. I can't imagine what I've been
      thinking of to overlook him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tell you what, we'll have a little rabbit to-morrow night. We four. We'll
      devote an evening to drawing Mr Humphrey Weaver out of his shell.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her quick eyes caught a doubtful look in Corinne's eyes. 'Oh,' she said,
      'we did speak of letting Will and Fred take us in town, didn't we?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Henry that he ought to take the situation in hand. As
      regarded his relations with Humphrey he was sailing under false colours.
      Among his confused thoughts he sought, gropingly, a way out. The speech he
      did make was clumsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know whether I could make him come. He likes to read evenings, or
      work in his shop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Henderson took this in, then let her eyes rest a moment, thoughtfully,
      on Henry's ingenuous countenance. An intent look crept into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you mean that you two sweep and make beds and wash dishes and dust?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well'&mdash;Henry's voice faltered&mdash;'you see, I haven't been&mdash;I
      just moved over there yesterday afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm!' There was a bright, flash in Mrs Henderson's eyes. She chuckled
      abruptly. It was a sharp little chuckle that had the force of an
      interruption. 'I'd like to see the corners of those rooms. There ought to
      be some woman that could take care of you.' She turned again on Henry. 'Be
      sure and bring him down to-morrow. Come in about six for a picnic supper.
      Or no&mdash;let me think&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's eyes were on Corinne. She was eating now, composedly, like an
      accomplished feminine fatalist, leaving the disposition of matters to her
      more aggressive hostess. The food he had eaten rested comfortably on his
      long ill-treated but still responsive young stomach. His nervous concern
      of the morning was giving place to a glow of snug inner well-being.
      Ice-cream was before him now, a heaping plate of it&mdash;vanilla, with
      hot chocolate sauce&mdash;and a huge slice of chocolate layer cake. He
      blessed Mrs Henderson for the rich cream as he let heaping spoonfuls slip
      down his throat and followed them with healthy bites of the cake. What a
      jolly little woman she was. No fuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing stuck up about her. And he knew she was on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had sympathy. Even if she hadn't yet heard&mdash;when she did hear&mdash;it
      wouldn't matter. She would be on his side; he was sure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne's hair, a loose curl of it, curved down over her ear and part of
      her cheek. She reached up a long hand and brushed it back. The motion
      thrilled him. He was quiveringly responsive to the faint down on her
      cheek, to the slight ebbing and flowing of the colour under her skin, to
      the whiteness of her temple, the curve of her rather heavy eyebrow, even
      to the 'waist' she wore&mdash;a simple garment, with an open throat and a
      wide collar that suggested the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Henderson was talking about something or other, in her brisk way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry only partly heard. He was day-dreaming, weaving an imaginative web
      of irridescent fancy about the healthy, rather matter-of-fact girl before
      him. And eating rapidly his second large helping of ice-cream, and his
      second piece of cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little resentments were still popping up among his thoughts, taunting him.
      But tentative little hopes were struggling with these now. A sense of
      power, even, was stirring to life in his breast. This brought new thrills.
      It was a long, long time since he had felt as he was now beginning to
      feel. Life had dealt pretty harshly with him these two years. But he
      wasn't beaten yet. Not even if nice men did give cameo brooches mounted on
      beaded gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pocket. Nearly all of the week's pay was there&mdash;about
      eight dollars. It wasn't much. It wouldn't buy gold brooches.
      Space-reporting on a country weekly at a dollar and a quarter a column, as
      a means of livelihood, was pretty hard sledding. He would have to scheme
      out something. There would be seventeen dollars more on the fifteenth from
      his Uncle Arthur, executor of his mother's estate and guardian to Henry,
      but that had been mentally pledged to the purchase of necessary summer
      underwear and things. Still, he might manage somehow. You had to do a lot
      for girls, of course. They expected it. Expensive business.
    </p>
    <p>
      He indulged himself a moment, shading his eyes with one hand and eating
      steadily on, in a momentary wave of bitterness against well-to-do young
      men who could lavish money on girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne was speaking now, and he was answering. He even laughed at
      something she said. But the train of his thoughts rumbled steadily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the coffee they all carried out the dishes and washed them. Henry
      amused them by wearing a full-length kitchen apron. Corinne tied the
      strings around his waist. He found an excuse to reach back, and for an
      instant his hands covered hers. She laughed a little. He danced about the
      kitchen and sang comic songs as he wiped dishes and took them to the china
      closet in the butler's pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      This chore finished, they went to the living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Henderson said: 'Oh, Corinne, you must hear Henry sing &ldquo;When Britain
      Really Ruled&rdquo; from <i>Iolanthe</i>.' She found the score and played for
      him. He sang lustily, all three verses.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too much dinner,' he remarked, beaming with pleasure, at the close.
      'Voice is rotten.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a good organ,' said Corinne. 'You ought to work at it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perfect shame he won't study,' said Mrs Henderson. Henry found <i>The
      Geisha</i> on the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come on, Corinne,' he cried. 'Do the &ldquo;Jewel of Asia.&rdquo; Mrs Henderson'll
      transpose it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne leaned carelessly against the piano and sang the pleasant little
      melody with an ease and a steady flow of tone that brought a shine to
      Henry's eyes. He had to hide it, dropping on the big couch and resting his
      head on his hand. He could look nowhere but at her. He ordered her to sing
      'The Amorous Goldfish.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell into the spirit of it, and moved away from the piano, looking
      provocatively at Henry, gesturing, making an audience of him. She even
      danced a few steps at the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sprang up. The power was upon him. Obstacles, difficulties, the
      little scene with Humphrey, while not forgotten, were swept aside. He was
      irresistible.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell you what,' he said gaily, with supreme ease&mdash;'w'e'll send those
      Chicago men a box of poisoned candy to-morrow, and&mdash;oh, yes w-e will!&mdash;and
      then we'll have a party at the rooms. You'll be chaperon, Mrs Henderson
      and Hump'll cook things in the chafing dish, and&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What a perfectly lovely idea!' said Mrs Henderson in a surprisingly calm
      voice. 'I'll bring the cold chicken, and a vegetable salad...
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry watched Corinne.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant&mdash;she was rummaging through the music&mdash;her eyes
      met his. 'It'll be fun,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry felt a shock as if he had plunged unexpectedly, headlong, into
      ice-water; then a glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a daring soul. They didn't understand him in Sunbury. He had
      temperament, a Bohemian nature. The thing was, he'd wasted two years
      trying to make another sort of himself. Kept account of every penny in a
      red book! All that! Book was in his pocket now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to tear it up. He wouldn't be a coward another day. That
      plodding self-discipline hadn't got him anywhere. Now really, had it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Little inner voices were protesting weakly. People might find out about
      it. Have to be pretty quiet. And keep the shades down. It wouldn't do for
      the folks in the parsonage, across the alley, to know that Mrs Arthur V.
      Henderson and her guest were in the Parmenter barn. Have to find some
      tactful way of suggesting that they come after dark...
    </p>
    <p>
      As if she could read his thoughts, Mrs Henderson remarked calmly: 'You
      come for us, Henry. Say about eight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the little voices of doubt and confusion. Even of fear. He mentally
      shouted them down; fixing his eyes on the disturbingly radiant Corinne,
      then glancing for moral support at the really pretty little Mrs Henderson
      who gave out such a reassuring air of knowing precisely what she was
      about, of being altogether in the right. Funny, knowing her all these
      years, he hadn't realised she was so nice!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had turned defeat into victory. Single-handed. Will and Fred could go
      sit on the Wells Street bridge and eat bananas. He had settled <i>their</i>
      hash.
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      To this lofty mood there came, promptly? an opposite and fully equal
      reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Difficulties having arisen in connection with the problem of breaking the
      news to Humphrey, he couldn't very well go back to the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing would have to be put right before Humphrey. He decided to think
      it over. That was the idea&mdash;think it over. Humphrey would be eating
      his supper, if not at the rooms, then at Stanley's little restaurant on
      Simpson Street. So he could hardly go to Stanley's. There was another
      little lunch room down by the tracks, but Humphrey had been known to go
      there. And of course it was impossible to return for a transient meal to
      Mrs Wilcox. For one thing, the student waiters would be off and Mamie
      Wilcox on duty in the dining-room. He didn't want Mamie back in his life.
      Not if he could help it. He even went so far as to wonder, with a
      paralysing sense of helplessness in certain conceivable contingencies, if
      he <i>could</i> help it... So instead of eating supper he sat on a
      breakwater, alone, unobserved, while the golden sunset glow faded from
      lake and sky and darkness claimed him for her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, handkerchief over face, rushing and pawing his way through the
      myriads of sand-flies that swarmed about each corner light, he walked into
      the neighbourhood of Martha Caldwell's house. He walked backhand forth for
      a time on the other side of the street, and stood motionless by trees. He
      found the situation trying, as he didn't know why he had come, whether he
      wanted to see Martha or what he could say to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could hear voices from the porch. And he thought he could see one white
      dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, because it seemed to be the next best thing to do, he crossed over
      and mounted the familiar front steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself touching the non-committal hand of James B. Merchant,
      Jr., who carried the talk along glibly, ignoring the gloomy youth with the
      glasses and the tiny moustache who sat in a shadow and sulked. Finally,
      after deliberately, boldly arranging a driving party of two for Monday
      evening, the cotillion leader left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha, when he had disappeared beyond the swirling, illuminated
      sand-flies at the corner, settled back in her chair and stared, silent, at
      the maples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry struggled for speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Martha, look here,' came from him, in a tired voice, 'you've cut me dead.
      Twice. Now it seems to me&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want to talk about that,' said Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it isn't fair not to&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please don't try to tell me that you weren't at Hoffmann's with that
      horrid girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not trying to. But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You took her there, didn't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, but she&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She didn't make you. You knew her pretty well. While you were going with
      me, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, well,' he muttered. Then, 'Thunder! If you're just determined not to
      be fair&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't let you say that to me.' The snap in her voice stung him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're not fair! You won't even let me talk!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What earthly good is talk!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, if you're going to take that attitude&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose. So did he.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't and I won't talk about a thing like that,' she said quickly,
      unevenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I suppose I'd better go,' said he, standing motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood and stood there. Across the street, at B. F. Jones's, a porch
      full of young people were singing <i>Louisiana Lou</i>. Henry, out of
      sheer nervousness, hummed it with them; then caught himself and turned to
      the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he remarked listlessly, 'I'll say good-night, then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she was silent. He lingered, but she gave him no help. He hadn't
      believed that she could be as angry as this. He waited and waited. He even
      felt and weighed the impulses to go right to her and make her sit in the
      hammock with him and bring back something of the old time feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he found himself moving off down the steps and heading for the yellow
      cloud at the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated the sand-flies. Their dead bodies formed a soft crunchy carpet on
      pavement and sidewalk. You couldn't escape them. They came for a week or
      two in June. They were less than an inch long, pale yellow with gauzy
      wings. They had neither sting nor pincers. They overwhelmed these lake
      towns by their mere numbers. Down by the bright lights on Simpson Street
      they literally covered everything. You couldn't see through a square inch
      of Donovan's wide plateglass front. Mornings it was sometimes necessary to
      clear the sidewalks with shovels.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two or three hours later when Henry crept cautiously into
      Humphrey's shop and ascended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey had left lights for him. He was awake, too; there was a crack of
      light at the bottom of his bedroom door. But the door was shut tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry put out all the lights and shut himself in his own disorderly room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a time looking at the mess; everything he owned, strewed
      about on chairs, table and floor. Everything where it had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered finishing unpacking the suit-case. Pushed it with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just have to get at these things,' he muttered aloud. 'Make a job of it.
      Do it the first thing to-morrow, before I go to the office.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he dug out the box of books that stood beside the bed, the volume
      entitled <i>Will Power and Self Mastery</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat on the bed for an hour, reading one or another of the vehemently
      pithy sentences, then gazing at the wall, knitting his brows, and mumbling
      the words over and over until the small meaning they had ever possessed
      was lost.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      He came almost stealthily into the office of <i>The Weekly Voice of
      Sunbury</i> on the Monday morning. He had not fallen really asleep until
      the small hours. When he awoke, Humphrey was long gone and the breakfast
      things stood waiting on the centre table. And there they were now. He
      hadn't so much as rinsed them in the sink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey sat behind his roll-top desk, back of the railing. Old Mr Boice,
      the proprietor, was at his own desk, out in front. At the first glimpse of
      his massive head and shoulders with the heavy white whiskers falling down
      on his shirt front, Henry, hesitating on the sill, gave a little quick
      sigh of relief. He let himself, moving with the self-consciousness that
      somewhat resembled dignity, through the gate in the railing and took his
      chair at the inkstained pine table that served him for a desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt Humphrey's eyes on him, and said 'Goodmorning!' stiffly, without
      looking round. He looked through the papers on the table for he knew not
      what; snatched at a heap of copy paper, bit his pencil and made a business
      of writing nothing whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven Mr Boice, who was also postmaster, lumbered out and along
      Simpson Street toward the post office. Henry, discovering himself alone
      with Humphrey, rushed, muttering, to the press room and engaged Jim Smith,
      the foreman, in talk which apparently made it necessary for that blonde
      little man, whose bare forearms were elaborately tattooed and who chewed
      tobacco, to come in, sit on Henry's table, and talk further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noon came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey pushed back his chair, tapped on the edge of his desk, and
      thoughtfully wrinkled his long face. The natural thing was for Henry to
      come along with him for lunch at Stanley's. He didn't mind for himself. It
      was quite as pleasant to eat alone. In the present circumstances, more
      pleasant. It was awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up; stood a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could feel the boy there, bending over proofs of the programmes for the
      Commencement 'recital' of the Music School, pencil poised, motionless,
      almost inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Henry muttered again, sprang up, rushed to the press room, proof
      in hand; and Humphrey went to lunch alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry did not appear again at the office. This was not unusual. Monday was
      a slack day, and much of Henry's work consisted in scouting along Simpson
      Street, looking up new real estate permits at the village office, new
      volumes at the library and other small matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unusual thing was the note on Humphrey's desk. Henry had put it on top
      of his papers and weighted it down conspicuously with the red ink bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've had to ask Mrs Henderson and Corinne Doag to the rooms to-night for
      a little party. I'll bring them about eight.' Pinned to the paper was a
      five-dollar banknote.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper-time, Humphrey, eating alone in Stanley's, saw a familiar figure
      outside the wide front window. It was Henry, dressed in his newest white
      ducks, his blue coat newly pressed (while he waited, at the Swede tailor's
      down the street), standing stiffly on the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally he glanced around, peering into the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light was failing in the rear of the store. Mrs Stanley came from her
      desk by the door and lighted two gas-jets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry again glanced around. He saw Humphrey and knew that Humphrey saw
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A youth on a bicycle paused at the curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the screen door Humphrey heard this conversation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hallo, Hen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hallo, Al!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Doing anything after?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;yeah. Got a date.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the other youth rode off, Henry glanced around once more,
      nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was carrying the bamboo stick he affected. He twirled this for a
      moment, and then wandered out of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon he reappeared, entered the restaurant and marched straight back
      to Humphrey's table. His sensitive lips were compressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said, 'Hallo, Hump!' and with only a moment's hesitation took the chair
      opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey buried his nose in his coffee cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry cleared his throat, twice; then, in a husky, weak voice, remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Get my note?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a painfully long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' Humphrey replied then, 'I did.' And went at the pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry picked up a corner of the threadbare table-cloth and twisted it. He
      had been pale, but colour was coming now, richly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he mumbled, 'I s'pose we've gotta say something about it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not necessary,' Humphrey observed briskly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, but&mdash;we'll have to plan&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;' Henry's voice broke and faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean&mdash;&mdash;' Humphrey's voice was clear, sharp.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ssh! Not so loud, Hump.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean that since you've done this extraordinary thing without so much as
      consulting me, I will see it through. I don't want you for one minute to
      think that I like it. God knows what it's going to mean&mdash;having women
      running in there! My privacy was the only thing I had. You've chosen to
      wreck it without a by-your-leave. I'll be ready at eight. And I'll see
      that the door of your room is shut.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With which he rose, handed his ticket to Mrs Stanley to be punched, and
      left the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry walked the streets, through gathering clouds of sand-flies, until it
      was time to call at Mrs Henderson's.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7
    </h3>
    <p>
      They stood on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is the shop,' Henry explained, 'where Hump works.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How perfectly fascinating!' exclaimed Mrs Henderson. Her quick eyes took
      in lathes, kites, models of gliders, tools. 'Bring him 'straight down
      here. I won't stir from this room till he's explained everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump!' called Henry, with austere politeness, up the stairway: 'Would you
      mind coming down?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He came&mdash;tall, stooping under the low lintel, in spotless white,
      distant in manner, but courteous, firmly courteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Henderson, prowling about, lifted a wheel in a frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What on earth is this thing?' she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A gyroscope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you do with it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey wound a long twine about the handle and set the wheel spinning
      like a top.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hold it by the handle,' said he. 'Now try to wave it around.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The apparently simple machine swung itself back to the horizontal with a
      jerk so violent that Mrs Henderson nearly lost her footing. Humphrey, with
      evident hesitation, caught her elbow and steadied her. She turned her eyes
      up to his, laughing, all interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit right down in that chair and explain it to me,' she cried. 'How on
      earth did it do that? It's uncanny.' And she seated herself on a
      work-bench, with a light little spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry showed Corinne up the stairs, Humphrey was talking with an
      eager interest that had not before been evident in him. And Mrs Henderson
      was listening, interrupting him where his easy flow of scientific terms
      and mechanical axioms ran too fast for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's pulse beat faster. Suddenly the pleasantly arranged old barn
      looked, felt different. Charm had entered it. And the exciting possibility
      of fellowship&mdash;a daring fellowship. He was up in the living-room now.
      Corinne was moving lazily, comfortably about, humming a song by the
      sensational new Richard Strauss who was upsetting all settled musical
      tradition just then, and prying into corners and shelves. She wore a
      light, shimmery, silky dress that gave out a faint odour of violets. It
      drugged Henry, that odour. He felt for the first time as if he belonged in
      these rooms himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne found the kitchen cupboard', and exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mildred!' she called down the stairs, in her rich drawling voice, 'come
      right up here&mdash;the cutest thing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Mildred Henderson coolly replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't bother me with cute things now. Play with Henry and keep quiet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Humphrey's voice droned on down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry dropped on the piano stool. Corinne was certainly less indifferent.
      A little.
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck chords; all he knew. He hummed a phrase of the Colonel's song in
      <i>Patience</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne drew a chair to the end of the keyboard and settled herself
      comfortably. 'Sing something,' she said. 'I love your voice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's no good,' said he, flushing with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely her interest was growing. He added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd a lot rather hear you.' But then, when she smilingly shook her head,
      promptly broke into&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      'If you want a receipt for that popular mystery
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Known to the world as a Heavy Dragoon,
    </p>
    <p class="indent10">
      Take all the remarkable people of history,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Rattle them off to a popular tune.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the trickiest and most brilliant patter song ever written, I think,
      not even excepting the Major General's song in <i>The Pirates</i>. Which,
      by the way, Henry sang next.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How on earth can you remember all those words!' Corinne murmured. 'And
      the way you get your tongue around them. I could never do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She tried it, with him; but broke down with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know hundreds of 'em,' he said expansively, and sang on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an opportunity he had not foreseen during this dreadful day. But
      here it was, and he seized it. The stage was set for his kind of things;
      all at once, as if by the merest accident. For the first time since the
      awkward Sunday morning on the beach he was able to turn on full the faucet
      that controlled his 'charm.' And he turned it on full. He had parlour
      tricks. Out of amateur opera experience he had picked up a superficial
      knack at comedy dancing. He did all he knew. He taught an absurd little
      team song and dance to Corinne, with Mrs Henderson (who had at last come
      up) improvising at the piano. And Corinne, flushed and pretty, clung to
      his hand and laughed herself speechless. Once in her desperate confusion
      over the steps she sank to the floor and sat in a merry heap until Henry
      lifted her up. Then Henry imitated Frank Daniels singing 'The man with an
      elephant on his hands,' and H. C. Bamabee singing <i>The Sheriff of
      Nottingham</i>, and De Wolf Hopper doing <i>Casey at the Bat</i>. All were
      clever bits; the 'Casey' exceptionally so. They applauded him. Even
      Humphrey, silent now, leaning on an end of the piano, watching Mrs
      Henderson's flashing little hands, clapped a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Humphrey went rather moodily to a window and peered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Henderson followed him; slipped her hand through his arm; asked
      quietly, 'Who lives across the alley?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the Presbyterian parsonage,' he replied, slightly grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after midnight when they set out, whispering, giggling a little in
      the alley, for Chestnut Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'These sand-flies are fierce,' said Henry. 'You girls better take our
      handkerchiefs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They circled on lawns to avoid the swirling, crunching, softly suffocating
      clouds of insects. Nearer the lake it grew worse. At the corner of
      Chestnut and Simpson they stopped short. Mrs Henderson, pressing the
      handkerchief to her face, clung in humorous helplessness to Humphrey's
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her. Suddenly he stooped, gathered her up in his arms as
      if she were a child, and carried her clear through the plague into the
      shadows of Chestnut Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, running with Corinne pressing close on his arm, caught a glimpse of
      his face. The expression on it added a touch of alarm to the pæan of joy
      in Henry's brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stepped within the Henderson screen door to say good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let's do something to-morrow night&mdash;walk or go biking or row on the
      lake,' said Mrs Henderson. 'You two had better come down for dinner. Any
      time after six.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How about you?' Henry whispered to Corinne. 'Do you want me to come...
      Will and Fred...'
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne's firm long hand slipped for a moment into his. He gripped it. The
      pressure was returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be silly!' she breathed, close to his ear.
    </p>
    <h3>
      8
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sand-flies served as an excuse for silence between Humphrey and Henry
      on the walk back. Nevertheless, the silence was awkward. It held until
      they were up in the curiously, hauntingly empty living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey scraped and lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, rather surprisingly unhappy again, was moving toward a certain
      closed door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell me,' said Humphrey gruffly, slowly, 'where is Mister Arthur V.
      Henderson?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He travels for the Camman Company, reapers and binders and ploughs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey very deliberately lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry moved on toward the closed door. Emotions were stirring
      uncomfortably within him. And conflicting impulses. Suddenly he shot out a
      muffled 'Good-night,' and entered the bedroom, shutting the door after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Humphrey&mdash;a gaunt figure in nightgown and slippers,
      pipe in mouth&mdash;tapped at that door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, only half undressed, flushed of face, dripping with sweat, quickly
      opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey looked down in surprise at a fully packed trunk and suit-case and
      a heap of bundles tied with odd bits of twine&mdash;sofa cushions, old
      clothes, what not.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's all this?' Humphrey waved his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;I just thought I'd go in the morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't be a dam' fool.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;but'&mdash;Henry threw out protesting hands&mdash;'I know I'm
      no good at all these fussy things. I'd just spoil your&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      The pipe waved again. 'That's all disposed of, Hen.' A somewhat wry smile
      wrinkled the long face. 'Mildred Henderson's running it, apparently.
      There's a certain Mrs Olson who is to come in mornings and clean up. And&mdash;oh
      yes, I've got a lot of change for you. Your share was only eight-five
      cents.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Henry looked at his feet; moved one of them
      slowly about on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We're different kinds,' said Humphrey. 'About as different as they
      make'em. But that, in itself, isn't a bad thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry clasped it; gulped down an all but uncontrollable uprush of feeling;
      looked down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey stalked back to his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus began the odd partnership of Weaver and Calverly. Though is not every
      partnership a little odd?

      III&mdash;THE STIMULANT

      1
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>iss Wombast looked
      up from her desk in the Sunbury Public Library and beheld Henry Calverly,
      3rd. Then with a slight fluttering of her pale, blue-veined eyelids and a
      compression of her thin lips she looked down again and in a neat practised
      librarian's hand finished printing out a title on the-catalogue card
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Henry Calverly was faintly disconcerting to her. Though it was only
      eleven o'clock, and a Tuesday, he was attired in blue serge coat, snow
      white trousers and (could she have seen through the desk) white stockings
      and shoes. His white <i>négligé</i> shirt was decorated at the neck with a
      'four-in-hand' of shimmering foulard, blue and green. In his left hand was
      a rolled-up creamy-white felt hat and the crook of a thin bamboo stick.
      With his right he fussed at the fringe on his upper lip, which was
      somewhat nearer the moustache stage than it had been last week. Behind his
      nose glasses and their pendant silk cord his face was sober; the gray-blue
      eyes that (Miss Wombast knew) could blaze with primal energy were gloomy,
      or at least tired; there was a furrow between his blond eyebrow's. He had
      the air of a youth who wants earnestly to concentrate without knowing
      quite how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wombast was a distinctly 'literary' person. She read Meredith,
      Balzac, De Maupassant, Flaubert, Zola, and Howells. She was living her way
      into the developing later manner of Henry James. She talked, on occasion,
      with an icy enthusiasm that many honest folk found irritating, of
      Stevenson's style and of Walter Pater.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Miss Wombast's habit to look in her books for complete
      identification of the living characters she met. She studied all of them,
      coolly, critically, at boardinghouse and library. Naturally, when a living
      individual refused to take his place among her gallery of book types, she
      was puzzled. One such was Henry Calverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had known something of his checkered career in high school, where he
      had directed the glee club, founded and edited <i>The Boys' Journal</i>,
      written a rather bright one-act play for the junior class. Indeed the
      village in general had been mildly aware of Henry. He had stood out, and
      Miss Wombast herself had sung a modest alto in the <i>Iolanthe</i> chorus,
      two years back, under Henry's direction and had found him impersonally,
      ingenuously masterful and a subtly pleasing factor in her thought-world.
      He had made a success of that mob. The big men of the village gave him a
      dinner and a purse of gold. After all of which, his mother had died, he
      had run, apparently, through his gifts and his earnings, and settled down
      to a curiously petty reporting job, trotting up and down Simpson Street
      collecting useless little items for <i>The Weekly Voice of Sunbury</i>.
      Other young fellows of twenty either went to college or started laying the
      foundations of a regular job in Chicago. Those that amounted to anything.
      You could see pretty plainly ahead of each his proper line of development.
      Yet here was Henry, who <i>had</i> stood out, working half-heartedly at
      the sort of job you associated with the off-time of poor students,
      dressing altogether too conspicuously, wasting hours&mdash;daytimes, when
      a young fellow ought to be working&mdash;with this girl and that. For a
      long time it had been the Caldwell girl. Lately she had seen him with that
      strikingly pretty but, she felt, rather 'physical' young singer who was
      visiting the gifted but whispered-about Mrs Arthur V. Henderson, of Lower
      Chestnut Avenue. Name of Doge, or Doag, or something like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry himself had been whispered about. Very recently. He had been seen at
      Hoffmann's Garden, up the shore, with a vulgar young woman in extremely
      tight bloomers. Of the working girl type. Had her out on a tandem.
      Drinking beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was, unable to forget those secretly stirring <i>Iolanthe</i> days,
      that Miss Wombast had looked about among her book types for a key to
      Henry, but without success. He didn't appear to be in De Maupassant. Nor
      in Balzac. In Meredith and James there was no one who said 'Yeah' and
      'Gotta' and spoke with the crude if honest throat 'r' of the Middle West
      and went with nice girls and vulgar girls and carried that silly cane and
      wore the sillier moustache; who had, or had had, gifts of creation and
      command, yet now, month in, month out, hung about Donovan's soda fountain;
      who never smoked and, apart from the Hoffmann's Garden incident, wasn't
      known to drink; and who, when you faced him, despite the massed evidence,
      gave out an impression of earnest endeavour. Even of moral purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she known him better Miss Wombast would have found herself the more
      puzzled. For Miss Wombast, despite her rather complicated reading, still
      clung in some measure to the moralistic teachings of her youth, believing
      that people either had what she thought of as character or else didn't
      have it, that people were either industrious or lazy, bright or stupid,
      vulgar or nice. Therefore the fact that Henry, while still wrecking his
      stomach with fountain drinks and (a recently acquired habit) with lemon
      meringue pie between meals, had not touched candy for two years&mdash;not
      a chocolate cream, not even a gum drop!&mdash;and this by sheer force of
      character, would have been confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      And to read his thoughts, as he stood there before her desk, would have
      carried her confusion on into bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mostly these thoughts had to do with money, and bordered on the desperate.
      Tentative little schemes for getting money&mdash;even a few dollars&mdash;were
      forming and dissolving rapidly in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was concerned because his sudden little flirtation with Corinne Doag,
      after a flashing start, had lost its glow. Only the preceding evening. He
      hadn't held her interest. The thrill had gone. Which plunged him into
      moods and brought to his always unruly tongue the sarcastic words that
      made matters worse. He was lunching down there to-day&mdash;he and
      Humphrey&mdash;and dreaded it, with moments of a rather futile, flickering
      hope. Deep intuition informed him that the one sure solution was money.
      You couldn't get on with a girl without it. Just about so far, then things
      dragged. And this, of course, brought him around the circle, back to the
      main topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking about his clothes. They, at least, should move Corinne.
      Along with the moustache, the cane, the cord on his glasses. He didn't see
      how people could help being a little impressed. Miss Wombast, even, who
      didn't matter. It seemed to him that she <i>was</i> impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking about Martha Caldwell., She was pretty frankly going with
      James B. Merchant, Jr., now. Henry was jealous of James B. Merchant, Jr.
      And about Martha his thoughts hovered with a tinge of romantic sadness. He
      would like her to see him to-day, in these clothes, with his moustache and
      cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wondering, with the dread that the prospect of mental effort always
      roused in him, how on earth he was ever to write three whole columns about
      the Annual Business Men's Picnic of the preceding afternoon. Describing in
      humorous yet friendly detail the three-legged race, the ball game between
      the fats and the leans, the dinner in the grove, the concert by Foote's
      full band of twenty pieces, the purse given to Charlie Waterhouse as the
      most popular man on Simpson Street. He had a thick wad of notes up at the
      rooms, but his heart was not in the laborious task of expanding them. He
      knew precisely what old man Boice expected of him&mdash;plenty of
      'personal mention' for all the advertisers, giving space for space. Each
      day that he put it off would make the task harder. If he didn't have the
      complete story in by Thursday night, Humphrey would skin him alive; yet
      here it was Wednesday morning, and he was planning to spend as much of the
      day as possible with the increasingly unresponsive Corinne. Life was
      difficult!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of a morbid craving in his digestive tract. He decided to get
      an ice-cream soda on the way back to the office. He would have liked about
      half a pound of chocolate creams. The Italian kind, with all the sweet in
      the white part. But here character intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corner of his mind dwelt unceasingly on queer difficult feelings that
      came. These had flared out in the unpleasant incident of Mamie Wilcox and
      the tandem; and again in the present flirtation with Corinne. In a way
      that he found perplexing, this stir of emotion was related to his gifts.
      He couldn't let one go without the other. There had been moments&mdash;in
      the old days&mdash;when a feeling of power had surged through him. It was
      a wonderful, irresistible feeling. Riding that wave, he was equal to
      anything. But it had frightened him. The memory of it frightened him now.
      He had put <i>Iolanthe</i> through, it was true, but he had also nearly
      eloped with Ernestine Lambert. He had completely lost his head&mdash;debts,
      everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was as well that Miss Wombast couldn't read his thoughts. She
      wouldn't have known how to interpret them. She hadn't the capacity to
      understand the wide swift stream of feeling down which an imaginative boy
      floats all but rudderless into manhood. She couldn't know of his pitifully
      inadequate little attempts to shape a course, to catch this breeze and
      that, even to square around and breast the current of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry said politely:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good-morning, Miss Wombast. I just looked in for the notes of new books.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh,' she replied quickly. 'I'm sorry you troubled. Mr Boice asked me to
      mail it to the office at the end of the month. I just sent it&mdash;this
      morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw his face fall. He mumbled something that sounded like, 'Oh&mdash;all
      right! Doesn't matter.' For a moment he stood waving his stick in jerky,
      aimless little circles. Then went off down the stairs.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      Emerging from Donovan's drug store Henry encountered the ponderous person
      of old Boice&mdash;six feet an inch and a half, head sunk a little between
      the shoulders, thick yellowish-white whiskers waving down over a black bow
      tie and a spotted, roundly protruding vest, a heavy old watch chain with
      insignia of a fraternal order hanging as a charm; inscrutable, washed-out
      blue eyes in a deeply lined but nearly expressionless face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stopped short; stared at his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice did not stop. But as he moved deliberately by, his faded eyes
      took in every detail of Henry's not unremarkable personal appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was thinking: 'Old crook. Wish I had a paper of my own here and I'd
      get back at him. Run him out of town, that's what!' And after he had
      nodded and rushed by, his colouring mounting: 'Like to know why I should
      work my head off just to make money for <i>him</i>. No sense in that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry came moodily into the <i>Voice</i> office, dropped down at his
      inkstained, littered table behind the railing, and sighed twice. He picked
      up a pencil and fell to outlining ink spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sighs were directed at Humphrey, who sat bent over his desk, cob pipe
      in mouth, writing very rapidly. 'He's got wonderful concentration,'
      thought Henry, his mind wandering a brief moment from his unhappy self.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey spoke without looking up. 'Don't let that Business Men's Picnic
      get away from you, Hen. Really ought to be getting it in type now. Two
      compositors loafing out there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sighed again; let his pencil fall on the table; gazed heavily,
      helplessly at the wall...
    </p>
    <p>
      'Old man say anything to you about the &ldquo;Library Notes&rdquo;?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey glanced up and removed his pipe. His swarthy long face wrinkled
      thoughtfully. 'Yes. Just now. He's going to have Miss Wombast send 'em in
      direct every month.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And I don't have 'em any more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey considered this fact. 'It doesn't amount to very much, Hen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no&mdash;works out about sixty cents to a dollar. It ain't that
      altogether&mdash;it's the principle. I'm getting tired of it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The press-room door was ajar, Humphrey reached out and closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry raised his voice; got out of his chair and sat on the edge of the
      table. His eyes brightened sharply. Emotion crept into his voice and shook
      it a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know what's he done to me&mdash;that old doubleface? Took me in
      here two years ago at eight a week with a promise of nine if I suited.
      Well, I did suit. But did I get the nine? Not until I'd rowed and begged
      for seven months. A year of that, a lot more work&mdash;You know! &ldquo;Club
      Notes,&rdquo; this library stuff, &ldquo;Real Estate Happenings,&rdquo; &ldquo;Along Simpson
      Street,&rdquo; reading proof&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey slowly nodded as he smoked.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&mdash;And I asked for ten a week. Would he give it? No! I knew I was
      worth more than that, so I offered to take space rates instead. Then what
      does he do? You know, Hump. Been clipping me off, one thing after another,
      and piling on the proof and the office work. Here's one thing more gone
      to-day. Last week my string was exactly seven dollars and forty-six cents.
      Dam it, it ain't fair! I can't <i>live!</i> I won't stand it. Gotta be ten
      a week or I&mdash;I'll find out why. Show-down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed to the door. Then, as if his little flare of indignation had
      burnt out, fingered there, knitting his brows and looking up and down the
      street and across at the long veranda of the Sunbury House, where people
      sat in a row in yellow rocking chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey smoked and considered him. After a little he remarked quietly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here, Hen, I don't like it any more than you do. I've seen what he
      was doing. I've tried to forestall him once or twice&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know it, Hump.' Henry turned. He was quite listless now. 'He's a tricky
      old fox. If I only knew of something else I could do&mdash;or that we
      could do together&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;this was what I was going to say&mdash;no matter how we feel,
      I'm going to be really in trouble if I don't get that picnic story pretty
      soon. Mr Boice asked about it this morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry leaned against Mr Boice's desk, up by the window; dropped his chin
      into one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll do it, Hump. This afternoon. Or to-night. We're going down to
      Mildred's this noon, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's part of what's bothering me. God knows how soon after that you'll
      break away from Corinne.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Pretty dam soon,' remarked Henry sullenly, 'the way things are going
      now.... I'll get at it, Hump. Honest I will. But right now'&mdash;he moved
      a hand weakly through the air&mdash;'I just couldn't. You don't know how I
      feel. I <i>couldn't!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where you going now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know.' The hand moved again. 'Walk around. Gotta be by myself.
      Sorta think it out. This is one of the days... I've been thinking&mdash;be
      twenty-one in November. <i>Then</i> I'll show him, and all the rest of
      'em. Have a little money then. I'll show this hypocritical old town a few
      things&mdash;a few things....'
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice died to a mumble. He felt with limp fingers at his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll be ready quarter or twenty minutes past twelve,' Humphrey called
      after him as he moved mournfully out to the street.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr Boice moved heavily along, inclining his massive head, without a smile,
      to this acquaintance and that, and turned in at Schultz and Schwartz's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectacle of Henry Calverly&mdash;in spotless white and blue, with the
      moustache, and the stick&mdash;had irritated him. Deeply. A boy who
      couldn't earn eight dollars a week parading Simpson Street in that rig, on
      a week-day morning! He felt strongly that Henry had no business sticking
      out that way, above the village level. Hitting you in the eyes. Young
      Jenkins was bad enough, but at least his father had the money. Real money.
      And could let his son waste it if he chose. But a conceited young chump
      like Henry Calverly! Ought to be chucked into a factory somewhere. Stoke a
      furnace. Carry boxes. Work with his hands. Get down to brass tacks and see
      if he had any stuff in him. Doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice made a low sound, a wheezy sound between a grunt and a hum, as he
      handed his hat to the black, muscular, bullet-headed, grinning Pinkie
      Potter, who specialised in hats and shoes in Sunbury's leading barber
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made another sound that was quite a grunt as he sank into the red plush
      barber chair of Heinie Schultz. His massive frame was clumsy, and the
      twinges of lumbago, varied by touches of neuritis, that had come steadily
      upon him since middle life, added to the difficulties of moving it about.
      He always made these sounds. He would stop on the street, take your hand
      non-committally in his huge, rather limp paw, and grunt before he spoke,
      between phrases, and when moving away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinie Schultz, who was straw-coloured, thin, listlessly patient (Bill
      Schwartz was the noisy fat one), knew that the thick, yellowish gray hair
      was to be cut round in the back and the neck shaved beneath it. The beard
      was to be trimmed delicately, reverently&mdash;'not cut, just the rags
      taken off'&mdash;and combed out. Heinie had attended to this hair and
      beard for sixteen years.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heard a good one,' murmured Heinie, close to his patron's ear. 'There was
      a bride and groom got on the sleeping car up to Duluth&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      A thin man of about thirty-five entered the shop, tossed his hat to
      Pinkie, and dropped into Bill Schwartz's chair next the window. The
      new-comer had straight brown hair, worn a little long over ears and
      collar. His face was freckled, a little pinched, nervously alert. Behind
      his gold rimmed spectacles his small sharp eyes appeared to be darting
      this way and that, keen, penetrating through the ordinary comfortable
      surfaces of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Robert A. McGibbon, editor and proprietor of the <i>Sunbury
      Weekly Gleaner</i>. He had appeared in the village hardly six months back
      with a little money&mdash;enough, at least, to buy the presses, give a
      little for good will, assume the rent and the few business debts that
      Nicholas Simms Godfrey had been able to contract before his health broke,
      and to pay his own board at the Wombasts' on Filbert Avenue. His
      appearance in local journalism had created a new tension in the village
      and his appearance now in the barber shop created tension there. Heinie's
      vulgar little anecdote froze on his lips. Mr Boice, impassive, heavily
      deliberate, after one glimpse of the fellow in the long mirror before him,
      lay back in the chair, gazed straight upward at the fly-specked ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice, when face to face with Robert A. McGibbon on the street,
      inclined his head to him as to others. But up and down the street his
      barely expressed disapproval of the man was felt to have a root in
      feelings and traditions infinitely deeper than the mere natural antagonism
      to a fresh competitor in the local field.
    </p>
    <p>
      For McGibbon was&mdash;the term was a new one that had caught the popular
      imagination and was worming swiftly into the American language&mdash;a
      yellow journalist. He had worked, he boasted openly, on a sensationally
      new daily in New York. In the once staid old <i>Gleaner</i> he used
      boldfaced headlines, touched with irritating acumen on scandal, assailed
      the ruling political triumvirate, and made the paper generally fascinating
      as well as disturbing. As a result, he was picking up subscribers rapidly.
      Advertising, of course, was another matter. And Boice had all the village
      and county printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The political triumvirate mentioned above was composed of Boice himself,
      Charles H. Waterhouse, town treasurer, and Mr Weston of the Sunbury
      National Bank. For a decade their rule had not been questioned along the
      street. The other really prominent men of Sunbury all had their business
      interests in Chicago, and at that time used the village merely for
      sleeping and as a point of departure for the very new golf links. Such
      men, I mean, as B. L. Ames, John W. MacLouden, William B. Snow, and J. E.
      Jenkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The experience of withstanding vulgar attacks was new to the triumvirate.
      (McGibbon referred to them always as the 'Old Cinch.') The <i>Gleaner</i>
      had come out for annexation to Chicago. It demanded an audit of Charlie
      Waterhouse's town accounts by a new, politically disinterested group. It
      accused the bank of withholding proper support from men of whom old Boice
      disapproved. It demanded a share of the village printing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 'Old Cinch' were taking these attacks in silence, as beneath their
      notice. They took pains, however, in casual mention of the new force in
      town, to refer to him always as a 'Democrat.' This damned him with many.
      He called himself an 'Independent.' Which amused Charlie Waterhouse
      greatly. Everybody knew that a man who wasn't a decent Republican had to
      be a Democrat. In the nature of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they were waiting for his money and his energy to give out. Giving
      him, as Charlie Waterhouse jovially put it, the rope to hang himself with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Schwartz took McGibbon's spectacles, tucked the towel around his
      scrawny neck, lathered chin and cheeks, and seizing his head firmly in a
      strong right hand turned it sidewise on the head-rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon lay there a moment, studying the yellowish-white whiskers that
      waved upward above the towels in the next chair. Bill stropped his razor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How are you, Mr Boice?' McGibbon observed, quite cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice made a sound, raised his head an inch. Heinie promptly pushed it
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quite a story you had last week about the musicale at Mrs Arthur V.
      Henderson's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice lay motionless. What was up! Distinctly odd that either journal
      should be mentioned between them. Bad taste. He made another sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who wrote it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry Calverly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thought so!' McGibbon chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice twisted his head around, trying to see the fellow in the mirror.
      Heinie pulled it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Got it here. Hand me my glasses, Bill, will you. Thanks.' McGibbon was
      sitting up, his face all lather, digging in his pocket. He produced a
      clipping. Read aloud with gusto:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Mrs Stelton's art has deepened and broadened appreciably since she last
      appeared in Sunbury. Always gifted with a splendid singing organ, always
      charming in personality and profoundly, rhythmically musical in
      temperament, she now has added a superstructure of technical authority
      which gives to each passage, whether bravura or pianissimo, a quality and
      distinction.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon was momentarily choked by his own almost noiseless laughter. Bill
      pushed his head down and went swiftly to work on his right cheek. Two
      other customers had come in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great stuff that!' observed McGibbon cautiously, under the razor.
      '&ldquo;Profoundly, rhythmically musical in temperament &ldquo;! &ldquo;A superstructure of
      technical authority&rdquo;! Great! Fine! That boy'll do something yet. Handled
      right. Wish he was working for me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice, from whom sounds had been coming for several moments, now raised
      his voice. It was the first time Heinie had ever heard him raise it. Bill
      paused, razor in air, and glanced around. Pinkie Potter looked up from the
      shoes he was polishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he roared huskily, 'what in hell's the matter with that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Bill turned McGibbon's head the other way. He too raised his
      voice. But cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing much. Nice lot o' words. Only Mrs Stelton wasn't there. Sprained
      her ankle in the Chicago station on the way out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Schwartz had a trumpet-like Prussian voice. The situation seemed to
      him to contain the elements of humour. He laughed boisterously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinie Schultz, more politic, tittered softly, shears against mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pinkie Potter laughed convulsively, and beat out an intricate rag-time
      tattoo on his bootblack's stand with his brush.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was Mr Boice's fixed habit to go on, toward noon, to the post-office.
      Instead, to-day, he returned to the <i>Voice</i> office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself at his desk for a quarter of an hour, doing nothing. He
      had the faculty of sitting still, ruminating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he reached out for the two-foot rule that always lay on his desk,
      and carefully measured a certain article in last week's paper. Then did a
      little figuring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, moved toward the door; turned, and remarked to the wondering
      Humphrey:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take fifteen inches off Henry's string this week, Weaver. A dollar 'n'
      five cents. Be at the post-office if anybody wants me.' And went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey himself measured Henry's article on the musicale. Old Boice had
      been accurate enough; it came to an even fifteen inches. Which at seven
      cents an inch, would be a dollar and five cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry reappeared and together they set out for Lower Chestnut Avenue,
      Humphrey found he hadn't the heart to break this fresh disappointment to
      his friend. He decided to let it drift until the Saturday. Something might
      turn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's mood had changed. He had left the office, an hour earlier, looking
      like a discouraged boy. Now he was serious, silent, hard to talk to. He
      seemed three years older. With certain of Henry's rather violently
      contrasted phases Humphrey was familiar; but he had never seen him look
      quite like this. Henry was strung up. Plainly. He walked very fast,
      striding intently forward. At least once in each block he found himself a
      yard ahead of his companion, checked himself, muttered a few words that
      sounded vaguely like an apology and then repeated the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Mrs Henderson's Henry was grave and curiously attractive. He had charm,
      no doubt of it&mdash;a sort of charm that women, older women, felt.
      Mildred Henderson distinctly played up to him. And Corinne, Humphrey
      noted, watched him now and then; the quietly observant keenness in her big
      dark eyes masked by her easy, lazy smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the close of luncheon Henry's evident inner tension showed signs of
      taking the form of gaiety. He acted like a young man wholly sure of
      himself. Humphrey's net impression, after more than a year and a half of
      close association with the boy, was that he couldn't ever be sure of
      himself. Not for one minute. Yet, when they threw down their napkins and
      pushed back their chairs, it was Henry who said, with an apparently easy
      arrogance back of his grain:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump, you've got to be going back so soon, we're going to give you and
      Mildred the living-room. We'll wash the dishes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey noted the quick little snap of amusement in Mrs Henderson's eyes
      (Henry had not before openly used her first name) and the demure,
      expressionless look that came over Corinne's face. Neither was displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mrs Henderson's, 'You'll do no such thing!' Henry responded smilingly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't be contradicted. Not to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne was still silent. But Mrs Henderson, now frankly amused, asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why the to-day, Henry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I don't know. Just the way I feel,' said he; and ushered her with
      mock politeness into the front room, then, gallantly, almost nonchalantly,
      took the elbow of the unresisting Corinne and led her toward the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey lighted a cigarette and watched them go. Then with a slight
      heightening of his usually sallow colour, followed his hostess into the
      living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be evident to the reader that among these four young persons,
      rather casually thrown together in the first instance, something of an
      'understanding' had grown up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been a furtive delight about their first gathering at Humphrey's
      rooms, a sense of exciting variety in humdrum village life, the very real
      and lively pleasure of exploring fresh personalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late years, looking back, it has seemed to me that Mildred Henderson
      never really belonged in Sunbury, where a woman's whole duty lay in
      keeping house economically and as pleasantly as might be for the husband
      who spent his days in Chicago. And in bearing and rearing his children. I
      never knew anything of her earlier life, before Arthur V. Henderson
      brought her to the modest house on Chestnut Avenue. I never could figure
      why she married him at all. Marriages are made in so many places besides
      Heaven! He used to like to hear her play.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days, and a little later, I judged her much as the village judged
      her&mdash;peering out at her through the gun-ports in the armour plate of
      self-righteousness that is the strong defence of every suburban community.
      But now I feel that her real mistake lay in waiting so long before
      drifting to her proper environment in New York. Like all of us, she had,
      sooner or later, to work out her life in its own terms or die alive of an
      atrophied spirit. She had gifts, and needed, doubtless, to express them. I
      can see her now as she was in Sunbury during those years&mdash;little,
      trim, slim, with a quick alert smile and snappy eyes. Not a beautiful
      woman, perhaps not even an out-and-out pretty one, but curiously
      attractive. She had much of what men call 'personality.' And she was
      efficient, in her own way. She never let her musical gift rust; practised
      every day of her life, I think. Including Sundays. Which was one of the
      things Sunbury held against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey, too, was using Sunbury as little more than a stop gap. We knew
      that sooner or later he would strike his gait as an inventor. He was quiet
      about it. Much thought, deep plans, lay back of that long wrinkly face.
      While he kept at it he was a conscientious country editor. But his heart
      was in his library of technical books, and in his workshop in the old
      Parmenter barn. He must have put just about all of his little inheritance
      into the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne Doag was distinctly a city person. And she was a real singer, with
      ambition and a firm, even hard purpose, I can see now, back of the
      languorous dusky eyes and the wide slow smile that Henry was not then man
      enough to understand. In those days, more than in the present, a girl with
      a strong sense of identity was taught to hide it scrupulously. It was
      still the century of Queen Victoria. The life of any live girl had to be a
      rather elaborate pretence of something it distinctly was not. For which
      we, looking back, can hardly blame her. Besides, Corinne was young,
      healthy, glowing with a quietly exuberant sense of life. I imagine she
      found a sort of pure joy, an animal joy, in playing with men and life. She
      wasn't dishonest. She certainly liked Henry. Particularly to-day. But this
      was the summer time. She was playing. And she liked to be, thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, could Humphrey have glanced into the butler's pantry, he
      would have concluded that he knew Henry Calverly not at all. And Miss
      Wombast, could she have looked in, would have been thrilled and
      frightened, perhaps to the point of never speaking to Henry again. And of
      never, never forgetting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the scene has a bearing on the later events of the day, we will take a
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood in the butler's pantry, Henry and Corinne. The shards of a
      shattered coffee cup lay unobserved at their feet. Out in the kitchen sink
      all the silver and the other cups and saucers lay in the rinsing rack, the
      soapsuds dry on them. Henry held Corinne in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry,' she whispered, 'we <i>must</i> finish the dishes! What on earth
      will Mildred think?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let her think!' said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne leaned back against the shelves, disengaged her hands long enough
      to smooth her flying blue-black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry, I never thought&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never thought what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait! My hair's all down again. They might come out here. I mean you
      seemed&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did I seem? Say it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh well&mdash;<i>Henry</i>!&mdash;I mean sort of&mdash;well, reserved. I
      thought you were shy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Think so now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;well, no. Not exactly. Wait now, you silly boy! Really, Henry,
      you musn't be so&mdash;so intense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I <i>am</i> intense. I'm not the way I look. Nobody knows&mdash;&mdash;'
      Here he interrupted himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Henry,' she breathed, her head on his shoulder now, her arm clinging
      about his neck. He felt very manly. Life, real life, whirled, glowed,
      sparkled about him. He was exultant. 'You dear boy&mdash;I'm afraid you've
      made love to lots of girls.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I <i>haven't!</i>' he protested, with unquestionable sincerity. 'Not to
      lots.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Silly!' A silence. Then he felt her draw even closer to him. 'Henry, talk
      to me! Make love to me! Tell me you'll take me away with you&mdash;to-day!&mdash;now!
      Make me feel how wonderful it would be! Say it, anyway&mdash;even if&mdash;oh,
      Henry, <i>say</i> it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Henry's mind went cold and clear. He was a little
      frightened. He found himself wondering if this tempestuous young woman who
      clung so to him could possibly be the easy, lazy, comfortably smiling
      Corinne. He thought of Carmen&mdash;the Carmen of Calvé. He had suped once
      in that opera down at the Auditorium. He had paid fifty cents to the supe
      captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thrill of the conqueror was his. But he was beginning to feel that
      this was enough, that he had best rest his case, perhaps, at this' point.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for asking her to fly away with him, he couldn't conscientiously so
      much as ask her to have dinner with him in Chicago. Not in the present
      state of his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      One fact, however, emerged. He must propose something. He could at least
      have it out with old Boice. Settle that salary business. He'd <i>have</i>
      to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another fact is that he was by no means so cool as he, for the moment,
      fancied himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door from dining-room to kitchen opened, rather slowly. There was a
      light step in the kitchen, and Mildred Henderson's musical little voice
      humming the theme of the Andante in the Fifth Symphony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry and Corinne leaped apart. She smoothed her hair again, and patted
      her cheeks. Then she took a black hair from his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard Mildred at the sink. Rinsing the dishes and the silver,
      doubtless.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hate to disturb you two,' she called, a reassuring if slightly humorous
      sympathy in her voice, 'but I promised Humphrey I'd get after you, Henry.
      He says you simply must get some work done to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood motionless, trying to think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do your work here,' Corinne whispered. 'Stay.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. 'A lot I'd get done&mdash;here with you. Now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll help you. Couldn't I be just a little inspiration to you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It ain't inspiring work.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry&mdash;write something for me! Write me a poem!
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Not to-day, though. Gotta do this Business Men's Picnic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said, 'Wait a minute;' went into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Going over town,' he remarked, offhand, to Mrs Henderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the outer door, Corinne murmured: 'You'll come back, Henry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      With a vague little wave of one hand, and a perplexed expression, he
      replied: 'Yes, of course.' And hurried off.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr Boice wasn't at his desk at the <i>Voice</i> sanctum. Henry could see
      that much through the front window.
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn't go in. He felt that he couldn't talk with Humphrey&mdash;or
      anybody&mdash;right now. Except old Boice. He was gunning for him. Equal
      to him, too. Equal to anything. Blazing with determination. Could lick a
      regiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found his employer down at the post-office. In his little den behind
      the money-order window. He asked Miss Hemple, there, if he could please
      speak to Mr Boice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again on this eventful day that conservative member of the village
      triumvirate found himself forced to gaze at the dressy if now slightly
      rumpled youth with a silly little moustache that he couldn't seem to let
      go of, and the thin bamboo stick with a crook at the end. The youth whose
      time was so valuable that he couldn't arrange to do his work. And once
      again irritation stirred behind the spotted, rounded-out vest and the
      thick, wavy, yellowish-white whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat back in his swivel chair; looked at Henry with lustreless eyes;
      made sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr Boice,' said Henry, 'I&mdash;I want to speak with you. It's&mdash;it's
      this way. I don't feel that you're doing quite the right thing by me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another sound from the editor-postmaster. Then silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You gave me to understand that I'd get better pay if I suited. Well, the
      way you're doing it, I don't even get as much. It ain't right! It ain't
      square! Now&mdash;well&mdash;you see, I've about come to the conclusion
      that if the work I do ain't worth ten a week&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be remembered of Norton P. Boice that he was a village politician
      of something like forty years' experience. As such he put no trust
      whatever in words. Once to-day he had raised his voice, and the fact was
      disturbing. He had weathered a thousand little storms by keeping his mouth
      shut, sitting tight. He never criticised or quarrelled. He disbelieved
      utterly in emotions of any sort. He hadn't written a letter in twenty-odd
      years. And he was not likely to lose his temper again this day&mdash;week&mdash;or
      month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry didn't dream that at this moment he was profoundly angry. Though
      Henry was too full of himself to observe the other party to the
      controversy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice clasped his hands on his stomach and sat still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry chafed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time Mr Boice asked, 'Have you done the story of the Business
      Men's Picnic?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Better get it done, hadn't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry shook his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice continued to sit&mdash;motionless, expressionless. His thoughts
      ran to this effect:&mdash;The article on the picnic was by far the most
      important matter of the whole summer. Every advertiser on Simpson Street
      looked for whole paragraphs about himself and his family. Henry was
      supposed to cover it. He had been there. It would be by no means easy,
      now, to work up a proper story from any other quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suppose,' he remarked, 'you go ahead and get the story in. Then we can
      have a little talk if you like. I'm rather busy this afternoon.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to say it ingratiatingly, but it sounded like all other sounds
      that passed his lips&mdash;colourless, casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood up very stiff; drew in a deep breath or two; His fingers
      tightened about his stick. His colour rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over; rested a hand on the corner of the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr Boice,' he said, firmly if huskily, and a good deal louder than was
      desirable, here in the post-office, within ear-shot of the moneyorder
      window&mdash;'Mr Boice, what I want from you won't take two minutes of
      your time. You'd better tell me, right now, whether I'm worth ten dollars
      a week to the <i>Voice</i>. Beginning this week. If I'm not&mdash;I'll
      hand in my string Saturday and quit. Think I can't do better'n this! I
      wonder! You wait till about next November. Maybe I'll show the whole crowd
      of you a thing or two! Maybe&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the second time on this remarkable day the unexpected happened to and
      through Norton P. Boice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, with an effort and a grunt, he got to his feet. Colour appeared in
      his face, above the whiskers. He pointed a huge, knobby finger at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Get out of here!' he roared. 'And stay out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry hesitated, swung away, turned back to face him; finally obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jobless, stirred by a rather fascinating sense of utter catastrophe,
      thinking with a sudden renewal of exultation about Corinne, Henry wandered
      up to the Y.M.C.A. rooms and idly, moodily, practise shooting crokinole
      counters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly he wandered out. An overpowering restlessness was upon him. He
      wanted desperately to do something, but didn't know what it could be. It
      was as if a live wild animal, caged within his breast, was struggling to
      get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked over to the rooms; threw off his coat; tried fooling at the
      piano; gave it up and took to pacing the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were peculiar difficulties here, in the big living-room. Corinne had
      spent an evening here. She had sat in this chair and that, had danced over
      the hardwood floor, had smiled on him. The place, without Her, was
      painfully empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew now that he wanted to write. But he didn't know what. The wild
      animal was a story. Or a play. Or a poem. Perhaps the poem Corinne had
      begged for. He stood in the middle of the room, closed his eyes, and saw
      and felt Corinne close to him. It was a mad but sweet reverie. Yes, surely
      it was the poem!
    </p>
    <p>
      He found pencil and paper&mdash;a wad of copy paper, and curled up in the
      window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things were not right. Not yet. He was the victim of wild forces. They
      were tearing at him. It was no longer restlessness&mdash;it was a mighty
      passion. It was uncomfortable and thrilling. Queer that the impulse to
      write should come so overwhelmingly without giving him, so far, a hint as
      to what he was to write. Yet it was not vague. He had to do it. And at
      once. Find the right place and go straight at it. It would come out. It
      would have to come out.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr Boice came heavily into the Voice office and sank into his creaking
      chair by the front window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey went swiftly, steadily through galley after galley of proof.
      Humphrey had the trained eye that can pick out an inverted <i>u</i> in a
      page of print at three feet. He smoked his cob pipe as he worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice drew a few sheets of copy paper from a pigeonhole, took up a
      pencil in his stiff fingers, and gazed down over his whiskers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a decade or more since the 'editor' of the Voice had done any
      actual work. Every day he dropped quiet suggestions, whispered a word of
      guidance to this or that lieutenant, and listened to assorted ideas and
      opinions. He was a power in the village, no doubt about that. But to
      compose and write out three columns of his own paper was hopelessly beyond
      him. It called for youth, or for the long habit of a country hack. The
      deep permanent grooves in his mind were channels for another sort of
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour he sat there. Gradually Humphrey became aware of him. It was
      odd anyway that he should be here. He seldom returned in the afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he looked over at the younger man, and made sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey raised his head; removed his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Guess you better fix up a little account of the Business Men's Picnic,
      Weaver,' he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry's doing that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice's massive head moved slowly, sidewise. 'No,' he said, 'he won't
      be doing it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey leaned back in his chair. His face wrinkled reflectively; his
      brows knotted. He held up his pipe; rubbed the worn cob with the palm of
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice got up and moved toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've let Henry go,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey went on rubbing his pipe; squinting at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice paused in the door; looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll ask you to attend to it, Weaver.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice stood looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Humphrey. 'Afraid I can't help you out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice stood motionless. There was no expression on his face, but
      Humphrey knew what the steady look meant. He added:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wasn't there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr Boice stood. Humphrey took a fresh galley proof from the hook and
      fell to work at it. After a little Mr Boice moved back to his desk and
      creaked down into his chair. Again he reached for the copy paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey, in a merciful moment when he was leaving for the day, thought of
      suggesting that Murray Johnston, local man for the City Press Association,
      might be called on in the emergency. He had been at the picnic. He could
      write the story easily enough, if he could spare the time. A faint smile
      flitted across his face at the reflection that it would cost old Boice
      five or six times what he was usually willing to pay in the <i>Voice</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Boice, bending over the desk, a pencil gripped in his fingers, a
      sentence or two written and crossed out on the top sheet of copy paper,
      did not so much as lift his eyes. And Humphrey went on out.
    </p>
    <h3>
      8
    </h3>
    <p>
      Humphrey let himself into Mrs Henderson's front hall, closed the screen
      door gently behind him, and looked about the dim interior. There seemed to
      be no one in the living-room. The girls were in the kitchen, doubtless,
      getting supper. Mildred had faithfully promised not to bother cooking
      anything hot. He hung up his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw a feminine figure up the stairs, curled on the top-step,
      against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Corinne. She was pressing her finger to her lips and shaking her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She motioned him out toward the kitchen. There he found his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Seen Henry?' he asked. 'Old Boice fired him to-day, and he's disappeared.
      Not at the rooms. And I looked in at the Y.M.C.A.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's here,' said Mildred. 'A very interesting thing is happening,
      Humphrey. I've always told you he was a genius.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what's up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We've got him upstairs at my desk. He's writing something.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it's a poem for Corinne.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'A poem! But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's really quite wonderful. Now don't you go and throw cold water on it,
      Humphrey.' She came over, very trim and pretty in her long apron, her face
      flushed with the heat of the stove, slipped her hand through his arm, and
      looked up at him. 'It's really very exciting. I haven't seen the boy act
      this way for two years. He came in here, all out of breath, and said he
      had to write. He didn't seem to know what. He's quite wild I never in my
      life saw such concentration. It seems that he's promised Corinne a poem.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wonder what's got into him,' Humphrey mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred returned to her salad dressing. 'Genius has got into him,' she
      said, a bright little snap in her eyes. 'And it's coming out. He's been up
      there nearly two hours now. Corinne's guarding. She'd kill you if you
      disturbed him. She peeked in a little while ago. She says there's a lot of
      it&mdash;all over the floor&mdash;and he was writing like mad. She
      couldn't see any of it. As soon as he saw her he yelled at her and waved
      her out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm!' said Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Humphrey, my dear,' said Mildred then, 'I'm really afraid we've got to
      watch those two a little. Something's been happening to-day. Corinne has
      gone perfectly mad over him&mdash;to-day&mdash;all of a sudden. She
      fretted every minute he was away. Henry doesn't know it, but Corinne is a
      pretty self-willed girl. And just now she's got her mind on him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She came over again, took his arm, and looked up at Humphrey. She was at
      once sophisticating and confiding. There was a touch of something that,
      might have been tenderness, even wistfulness, in her voice as about her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've really been worrying a little about them. About Henry particularly,
      for some reason.' She gave a soft little laugh, and pressed his arm.
      'They're so young, Humphrey&mdash;such green little things. Or he is, at
      least. I've been impatient for you to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I got down as soon as I could,' said Humphrey, looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been worrying about him, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When the supper was ready, Mildred made Humphrey sit at the table and
      herself tiptoed up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came back, still on tiptoe, smiling as if at her own thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He won't eat,' she explained. 'He's still at it. I wish you could see my
      room. It's a sight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Corinne coming down?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not she. She won't budge from the stairs. And she flared up when I
      suggested bringing up a tray. I never thought that Corinne was romantic,
      but... Well, it gives us a nice little <i>téte-à-tête</i> supper. I've
      made iced coffee, Humphrey. Just dip into the salad, won't you!' After
      supper they went out to the hall. Corinne, still on the top step, had
      switched on the light and was sorting out a pile of loose sheets. She
      beckoned to them. They came tiptoeing up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't make it out,' she whispered. 'It isn't poetry. And he doesn't
      number his pages.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How did you ever get them?' asked Mildred.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Went in and gathered them up. He didn't hear me. He's still at it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey reached for the sheets; held them to the light; read bits of this
      sheet and that; found a few that went together and read them in order;
      finally turned a wrinkled astonished face to the two young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' they asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled softly. 'Well, it isn't poetry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw that much,' Corinne murmured, rather mournfully. 'It's&mdash;wait a
      minute! I couldn't believe it at first. It&mdash;no&mdash;yes, that's what
      it is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>What!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Humphrey dropped down at Mildred's feet, and laughed, softly at
      first, then with increasing vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred clapped her hand over his mouth and ran him down the stairs and
      through into the living-room. There they dropped side by side on the sofa
      and laughed until tears came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne, laughing a little herself now, but perplexed, followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here,' said Humphrey, when he could speak, 'let's get into this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved, to the table. Humphrey spread out the pages, and skimmed them
      over with a practised eye, arranging as he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he muttered, 'What on earth!' And shortly after: 'Why, the young
      devil!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please&mdash;' said Corinne. 'Please! I want to know what it is.',
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey stacked up the sheets, and laid them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he remarked, 'it is certainly an account of the Business Men's
      Picnic. And it certainly was <i>not</i> written for <i>The Weekly Voice of
      Sunbury</i>. I'll start in a minute and read it through. But from what
      I've seen&mdash;&mdash; Well, while it may be a little Kiplingesque&mdash;naturally&mdash;still
      it comes pretty close to being a work of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell you what the boy's done. He's gone at that little community outing
      just about as an artistic god would have gone at it. As if he'd never seen
      any of these Simpson Street folks before. Berger, the grocer, and William
      F. Donovan, and Mr Wombast, and Charlie Waterhouse, and Weston of the
      bank, and&mdash;and, here, the little Dutchman that runs the lunch counter
      down by the tracks, and Heinie Schultz and Bill Schwartz, and old Boice!
      It's a crime what he's done to Boice. If this ever appears, Sunbury will
      be too small for Henry Calverly. But, oh, it's grand writing.... He's
      got'em all in, their clothes, their little mannerisms&mdash;their tricks
      of speech... Wait, I'll read it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Forty minutes later the three sat back in their chairs, weak from
      laughter, each in his own way excited, aware that a real performance was
      taking place, right here in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'One thing I don't quite understand,' said Mildred. 'It's a lovely bit of
      writing&mdash;he makes you see it and feel it&mdash;where Mr Boice and
      Charles Waterhouse were around behind the lemonade stand, and Mr
      Waterhouse is upset because the purse they're going to surprise him with
      for being the most popular man in town isn't large enough. What <i>is</i>
      all that, anyway?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know,' said Humphrey. 'I was wondering about that. It's funny as the
      dickens, those two birds out there behind the lemonade stand quarrelling
      about it. It's&mdash;let's see&mdash;oh, yes! And Boice says, &ldquo;It won't
      help you to worry, Charlie. We're doing what we can for you. But it'll
      take time. And it's a chance!&rdquo;... Funny!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered the manuscript, and stared at the wall. 'Hm!' he remarked
      thoughtfully. 'Mildred, got any cigarettes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I have, but I don't care to be mystified like this. Take one, and
      tell me exactly what you're thinking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm thinking that Bob McGibbon would give a hundred dollars for this
      story as it stands, right now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because he's gunning for Charlie. And for Boice.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what's this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Evidence.' Humphrey was grave now. 'Not quite it. But warm. Very warm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's really stumbled on something. How perfectly lovely!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And he doesn't know it. Sees nothing but the story value of it. But it
      may be serious. They'd duck him in the lake. They'd drown him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how lovely if Henry, by one stroke of his pencil, should really
      puncture the frauds in this smug town.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There is something in that,' mused Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ssh!' From Mildred.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard a slow step on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment, and Henry appeared in the doorway. He stopped short when he saw
      them. His glasses hung dangling against his shirt front. He was coatless,
      but plainly didn't know it. His straight brown hair was rumpled up on one
      side and down in a shock over the farther eye. He was pale, and looked
      tired about the eyes. He carried more of the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at them as if he couldn't quite make them out, or as if not sure
      he had met them. Then he brushed a hand across his forehead and slowly,
      rather wanly, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I had no idea it was so late,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred and Corinne fed him and petted him while Humphrey drew a big chair
      into the dining-room, smoked cigarette after cigarette, and studied the
      brightening, expanding youth before him. He reflected, too, on the
      curious, instant responsiveness that is roused in the imaginative woman at
      the first evidence of the creative impulse in a man. As if the elemental
      mother were moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's probably it,' he thought. 'And it's what the boy has needed.
      Martha Caldwell couldn't give it to him&mdash;never in the world! He was
      groping to find it in that tough little Wilcox girl. It wouldn't do to
      tell him&mdash;no, I mustn't tell him; got to steady him down all I can&mdash;but
      I rather guess he's been needing a Mildred and a Corinne. These two
      years.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      9
    </h3>
    <p>
      Humphrey stood up then, said he was going out for half an hour, and picked
      up the manuscript from the living-room table as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went straight to Boice's house on Upper Chestnut Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What has all this to do with me?' asked Mr Boice, behind closed doors in
      his roomy library. 'Let him write anything he likes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey sat back; slowly turned the pages of the manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This,' he said, 'is a real piece of writing. It's the best picture of a
      community outing I ever read in my life. It's vivid. The characters are so
      real that a stranger, after reading this, could walk up Simpson Street and
      call fifteen people by name. He'd know how their voices sound, what their
      weaknesses are, what they're really thinking about Sunday mornings in
      church. It is humour of the finest kind. But they won't know it on Simpson
      Street. They'll be sore as pups, every man. He's taken their skulls off
      and looked in. He's as impersonal, as cruel, as Shakespeare.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This sounded pretty highfalutin' to Mr Boice. He made a reflective sound;
      then remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You think the advertisers wouldn't like it,'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They'd hate it. They'd fight. It would raise Ned in the town. But
      McGibbon wouldn't mind. Or if he didn't have the nerve to print it, any
      Sunday editor in Chicago would eat it alive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey quietly interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Little scenes, all through. Funny as Pickwick. There really is a touch of
      genius in it. Handles you pretty roughly. But they'd laugh. No doubt about
      that. All sorts of scenes&mdash;you and Charlie Waterhouse behind the
      lemonade stand&mdash;Bill Parker's little accident in the tug-of-war.' He
      read on, to himself. But he knew that Mr Boice sat up stiffly in his
      chair, with a grunt. He heard him rise, ponderously, and move down the
      room; then come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he spoke, Humphrey, aware of his perturbation, was moved to momentary
      admiration by his apparent calmness. He sounded just as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you getting at?' he asked. 'You want something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want you to take Hemy back at&mdash;say, twelve a week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm. Have him re-write this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Henry won't be able to write another word this week. He's empty. My
      idea is, Mr Boice, that you'll want to do the cutting yourself. When
      you've done that, I'll pitch in on the re-write. We can get our three
      columns out of it all right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's one thing you may be sure of. Henry doesn't know what he's
      written. No idea. It's a flash of pure genius.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't know that we've got much use for a genius on the <i>Voice</i>,'
      grunted Mr Boice. 'He ought to go to Chicago or New York.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He will, some day.' Humphrey rose. 'Will you send for him in the
      morning?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Then a sound. Then:&mdash;'Tell him to come
      around.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twelve a week, including this week?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The massive yellowish-gray head inclined slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Very well, I'll tell him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can leave the manuscript here, Weaver.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.' Humphrey deliberately folded it and put it in an inside pocket.
      'Henry will have to give it to you himself. It's his. Good-night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on the street, Humphrey reflected, with a touch of exuberance rare in
      his life:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'We won't either of us be long on the <i>Voice</i>. Not now. But it's
      great going while it lasts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he wondered, with a little stir of excitement, just why that purse
      wasn't enough for Charlie Waterhouse... just what old Boice knew... Why it
      was a chance! Curious! Something back of it, something that McGibbon was
      eternally pounding at&mdash;hinting&mdash;insinuating. Something real
      there; something that might never be known.
    </p>
    <h3>
      10
    </h3>
    <p>
      Humphrey felt that the little triumph&mdash;though it might indeed prove
      temporary; any victory over old Boice in Sunbury affairs was likely to be
      that&mdash;called for celebrating in some special degree. He had, it
      seemed, a few bottles of beer at the rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      So thither they adjourned; Mildred and Humphrey strolling slowly ahead,
      Corinne and Henry strolling still more slowly behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry seemed fagged. At least he was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne, stirred with a sympathetic interest not common to her sort of
      nature, stole hesitant glances at him, even, finally, slipped her hand
      through his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung back. Mildred and Humphrey disappeared in the shadows of the
      maples a block ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you're pretty tired, aren't you?' Corinne murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice seemed to waken him out of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;I&mdash;what was that? Oh&mdash;tired? Why, I don't know. Sorta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand slipped down his forearm, within easy reach of his hand; but he
      was unaware.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm frightfully excited,' he said, brightening. 'If you knew what this
      meant to me! Feeling like this. The Power&mdash;but you wouldn't know what
      that meant. Only it lifts me up. I know I'm all right now. It's been an
      awful two years. You've no idea. Drudgery. Plugging along. But I'm up
      again now. I can do it any time I want. I'm free of this dam' town. They
      can't hold me back now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll do big things,' she said, a mournful note in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know. I feel that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she stopped short. In a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' he asked casually. 'What's the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at his face; then down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you think you'll write&mdash;a poem?' she asked almost sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe. I don't know. It's queer&mdash;you get all stirred up inside, and
      then something comes. You can't tell what it's going to be. It's as if it
      came from outside yourself. You know. Spooky.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved on now, bringing him with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mildred and Humphrey'll wonder where we are,' she said crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry glanced down at her; then at the shadowy arch of maples ahead. He
      wondered what was the matter with her. Girls were, of course, notoriously
      difficult. Never knew their own minds. He was exultantly happy. It had
      been a great day. Twelve a week now, and going up! Hump was a good old
      soul.... He recalled, with a recurrence of both the thrill and the
      conservatism that had come then, that he had had a great time with Corinne
      in the early afternoon. Mustn't go too far with that sort of thing, of
      course. But she was sure a peach. And she didn't seem the sort that would
      be for ever trying to pin you down. He took her hand now. It was great to
      feel her there, close beside him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne walked more rapidly. He didn't know that she was biting her lip.
      Nor did he perceive what she saw clearly, bitterly; that she had
      unwittingly served a purpose in his life, which he would never understand.
      And she saw, too, that the little job was, for the present, at least, over
      and done with.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stole another sidelong glance at him. He was twisting up the ends of
      his moustache. And humming.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rom the university
      clock, up in the north end of Sunbury village, twelve slow strokes boomed
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Calverly, settled comfortably in the hammock on Mrs Arthur V.
      Henderson's front porch, behind the honeysuckle vine, listened dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside him in the hammock was Corinne Doag.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner, two houses away, a sizzing, flaring, sputtering arc lamp
      gave out the only sound and the only light in the neighbourhood. Lower
      Chestnut Avenue was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The storage battery in the modern automobile will automatically cut itself
      off from the generator when fully charged. Henry's emotional, nature was
      of similar construction. Corinne had overcharged him, and automatically he
      cut her off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outer result of this action and reaction was a rather bewildering
      quarrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the present evening, shortly after Humphrey Weaver and Mrs
      Henderson left the porch for a little ramble to the lake&mdash;'Back in a
      few minutes,' Mildred had remarked&mdash;the quarrel had been made up.
      Neither could have told how. Each felt relieved to be comfortably back on
      a hammock footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, indeed, was more than relieved. He was quietly exultant. The thrill
      of conquest was upon him. It was as if she were an enemy whom he had
      defeated and captured. He was experiencing none of the sensations that he
      supposed were symptoms of what is called love. Yet what he was
      experiencing was pleasurable. He could even lie back here and think coolly
      about it, revel in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne's head stirred.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That was midnight,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What of it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose I ought to be thinking about going in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't see that your chaperon's in such a rush.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know. They've been hours. They might have walked around to the rooms.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was a little shocked at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no,' he remarked. 'They'd hardly have gone <i>there</i>&mdash;without
      us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mildred would if she wanted to. It has seemed to me lately...'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know&mdash;but once or twice&mdash;as if she might be getting a
      little too fond of Humphrey.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh'&mdash;there was concern in Henry's voice&mdash;'do you think so?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wonder if you know just how fascinating that man is, Henry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's never been with girls&mdash;not around here. You've no idea&mdash;he
      just lives with his books, and in his shop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps that's why,' said she. 'Partly. Mildred ought to be careful.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, soberly considering this new light on his friend, looked off toward
      the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry' For goodness' sake! Ouch&mdash;my hair!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ssh! Look&mdash;that man coming across! Wait. There now&mdash;with a
      suit-case!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Henry, you scared me! Don't be silly. He's way out in... Henry! How
      awful! It <i>is!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What'll we do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. Get up. Sit over there,' She was working at her hair; she
      smoothed her 'waist,' and pulled out the puff sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man came rapidly nearer. His straw hat was tipped back. They could see
      the light of a cigar. A mental note of Henry's was that Arthur V.
      Henderson had been a football player at the state university. And a boxer.
      Even out of condition he was a strong man.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Quick&mdash;think of something to tell him! It'll have to be a lie. Henry&mdash;<i>think!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he stood motionless, helpless, she got up, thrust his hat and
      bamboo stick into his hands, and led him on tiptoe around the corner of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We've got to do something. Henry, for goodness' sake&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We've got to find her, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know it. But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If she came in with Hump, and he&mdash;you know, this time' of night&mdash;why,
      something awful might happen. There might be murder. Mr Henderson&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't talk such stuff! Keep your head. Well&mdash;he's coming! Here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She gripped his hand, dragged him down the side steps, and ran lightly
      with him out past the woodshed to the alley. They walked to the side
      street and, keeping in the shadows, out to the Chestnut Avenue corner.
      From this spot they commanded the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson had switched on lights in front hall, dining-room, and
      kitchen. The parlour was still dark. Next he had gone upstairs, for there
      were lights in the upper windows. After a brief time he appeared in the
      front doorway. He lighted a fresh cigar, then opened the screen door and
      came out on the porch. He stood there, looking up and down the street.
      Then he seated himself on the top step, elbows on knees, like a man
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen! You go over to the rooms and see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But they might be down at the lake.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not all this time. Mildred doesn't like sitting on beaches. If you find
      them, bring her back. We'll go in together, she and I. We'll patch up a
      story. It's all right. Just keep your head.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What'll you do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't like to leave you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll see me again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know, but&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well... Now hurry!'
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      The old barn was dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm!' mused Henry, pulling at his soft little moustache. 'Hm! Certainly
      aren't here. Take a look though.'
    </p>
    <p>
      With his latch-key he softly opened the alley door; felt his way through
      machinery and belting to the stairs. At the top he stood a moment, peering
      about for the electric switch. He hadn't lived here long enough to know
      the place as he had come to know his old room in Wilcox's boarding-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice&mdash;Humphrey's&mdash;said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't turn the light on.' Then, 'Is it you, Hen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were&mdash;over in the farther window-seat&mdash;sitting very
      still, huddled together&mdash;a mere faint shape against the dim outside
      light. He felt his way around the centre table, toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Looking for you,' he said. His voice was husky. There was a throbbing in
      his temples. And he was curiously breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood. It was going to be hard to tell them. He hadn't thought of this;
      had just rushed over here, headlong.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose it's pretty late,' said Mildred. There was a dreamy quality in
      her voice that Henry had not heard there before. He stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well'&mdash;Humphrey's voice had the dry, even slightly acid quality that
      now and then crept into it&mdash;'anything special, Hen? Here we are!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry cleared his throat. That huskiness seemed unconquerable. And his
      over-vivid imagination was playing fantastic tricks on him. Hideous little
      pictures, very clear. Wives murdering husbands; husbands murdering lovers;
      dragged-out, soul-crushing scenes in dingy, high-ceiled court-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey got up, drew down the window shade behind Mrs Henderson, and
      turned on the light. She shielded her eyes with a slim hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, staring at her, felt her littleness; paused in the rush of his
      thoughts to dwell on it. She looked prettier to-night, too. The softness
      that had been in her voice was in her face as well, particularly about the
      half-shadowed mouth. She was always pretty, but in a trim, neat, brisk
      way. Now, curled up there in the window-seat, her feet under her very
      quiet', she seemed like a little girl that you would have to protect from
      the world and give toys to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, to his own amazement&mdash;and chagrin&mdash;covered his face and
      sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good lord!' said Humphrey. 'What's all this? What's the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The long silence that followed was broken by Mildred. Still shielding her
      eyes, without stirring, she asked, quietly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has my husband come home?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's Corinne?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She&mdash;she's waiting on the corner, in case you....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred moved now; dropped her chin into her hand, pursed her lips a
      little, seemed to be studying out the pattern of the rug.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he&mdash;did he see either of you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred pressed a finger to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We mustn't leave Corinne waiting out there,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey dropped down beside her and took her hand. His rather sombre gaze
      settled on her face and hair. Thus they sat until, slowly, she raised her
      head and looked into his eyes. Then his lips framed the question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stay here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes widened a little, and slowly filled. She gave him her other hand.
      But she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come then, dear. We'll go down there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      From the top of the stairs he switched on a light in the shop. Mildred,
      very palet went down. Henry was about to follow. But he saw Humphrey
      standing, darting glances about the room, softly snapping his bony
      fingers. The long, swarthy face was wrinkled into a scowl. His eyes rested
      on Henry. He gave a little sigh; threw out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's&mdash;it's the limit!' he whispered. 'You see&mdash;my hat....'
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to be all he could say. His face was twisted with emotion. His
      mouth even moved a little. But no sound came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood waiting. At the moment his surging, uncontrollable emotion
      took the form of embarrassment. It seemed to him that in this crisis he
      ought to be polite toward his friend. But they couldn't stand here
      indefinitely without speaking. There was need, particular need, of
      politeness toward Mildred Henderson. So, mumbling, he followed her
      downstairs and out through the shop to the deserted alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went down to Chestnut Avenue. Mildred and Humphrey were silent,
      Walking close together, arm in arm. Henry, in some measure recovered from
      his little breakdown, or relieved by it, tried to make talk. He spoke of
      the stillness of the night. He said, 'It's the only time I like the town&mdash;after
      midnight. You don't have to see the people then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as they offered no reply, he too fell still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne, when they found her leaning against a big maple, was in a
      practical frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There he is,' she whispered. 'Been sitting right there all the time. This
      is his third cigar. Now listen, Mildred. I've figured it all out. No good
      in letting ourselves get excited. It's all right. You and I will walk up
      with Henry. Just take it for granted that you've been down to the lake
      with us. We needn't even explain.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred, still nestling close to Humphrey's arm, seemed to be looking at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they heard her draw in her breath rather sharply, and her hand groped
      up toward Humphrey's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait!' she said breathlessly. 'I can't go in there now. Not right now.
      Wait a little. I can't!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey led her away into the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne looked at Henry. 'Hm!' she murmured&mdash;'serious!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The university clock struck one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Henry felt that pressure in the temples and dryness in the throat.
      His thoughts, most of them, were whirling again. But one corner of his
      mind was thinking clearly, coldly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'This is the real thing. Drama! Life! Maybe tragedy! And I'm seeing it!
      I'm in it, part of it!'
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      Corinne was peering into the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where'd they go?' she said. 'We've got to find them. This thing's getting
      worse every minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred and Humphrey were sitting on a horse block, side by side, very
      still. It was in front of the B. L. Ames place. Corinne stood over them.
      But Henry hung back; leaned weakly against a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ames place brought up memories of other years and other girls. An odd
      little scene had occurred here, with Clemency Snow, on one of the lawn
      seats. And a darker mass of shadow in the gnarled, low-spreading oak, over
      by the side fence, was a well-remembered platform with seats and a ladder
      to the ground. Ernestine Lambert had been the girl with him up there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two long years back! He was eighteen then&mdash;a mere boy, with illusions
      and dreams. He wasn't welcome to Mary Ames's any more. She didn't approve
      of him. Her mother, too. And he had sunk into a rut of small-town work on
      Simpson Street. They weren't fair to him. He didn't drink; smoked almost
      none; let the girls alone more than many young fellows&mdash;in spite of a
      few little things. If he had money... of course. You had to have money.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt old. And drab of spirit. Those little affairs, even the curious
      one with Clem Snow, had been, it seemed now, on a higher plane of feeling
      than this present one with Corinne. Life had been at the spring then, the
      shrubs dew-pearled, God in his Heaven. And the affair with Ernestine had
      not been so little. It had shaken him. He wondered where Ernie was now.
      They hadn't written for a year and a half. And Clem was Mrs Jefferson
      Jenkins, very rich (Jeff Jenkins was in a bond house on La Salle Street)
      living in Chicago, on the Lake Shore Drive, intensely preoccupied with a
      girl baby. People&mdash;women and girls&mdash;said it was a beautiful
      baby. Girls were gushy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pressed a hand to his eyes. Corinne was right; the situation was
      getting worse every minute. During one or two of the minutes, while his
      memory was active, it had seemed like an unpleasant dream from which he
      would shortly waken. But it wasn't a dream. He felt again the tension of
      it. It was a tension that might easily become unbearable. First thing they
      knew the university clock would be striking two. He began listening for
      it; trying absurdly to strain his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had recently seen Minnie Maddem play <i>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</i>,
      and had experienced a painful tension much like this&mdash;a strain too
      great for his sensitive imagination. He had covered his face. And he
      hadn't gone back for the last act.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was to be no running out of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' said Corinne, almost briskly, 'we're not getting anywhere.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey threw out his hand irritably.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just&mdash;just wait a little,' he said. 'Can't you see....'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's past one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne's manner jarred a little on all three of the others. Mildred
      seemed to sink even closer toward Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry felt another sob coming. Desperately he swallowed it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey, holding Mildred's head against his shoulder, looked up at
      Corinne. His face was not distinctly visible; but he seemed to be studying
      the tall, easy-going, unexpectedly practical girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think you understand,' he finally said. 'It's very, very awkward.
      My hat is in there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In the parlour. On the piano, I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think he lighted the parlour. We three can go up just the same.
      Now listen. Henry can leave his hat here with you, and get yours when he
      comes away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has my initials in it,' said Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne walked on the grass to the corner; came swiftly back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' she remarked dryly, 'he's been in there. The parlour's lighted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred stirred. 'Please!' she murmured. 'Just give me a minute or two.
      I'm going with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suppose,' said Corinne, 'he <i>has</i> seen the initials.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred's eyes sought Humphrey's. For a long instant, her head back on his
      shoulder, she gazed at him with an intensity that Henry had not before
      seen on a woman's face. It was as if she had forgotten himself and
      Corinne. And then Humphrey's arm tightened about her, as if he, too, had
      forgotten every one and everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had to turn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked to the corner. Neither Humphrey nor Mildred knew whether he went
      or stayed. Corinne was frowning down at them; thinking desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stared at the house, at the dim solitary figure on the top step, at
      the little red light of the cigar that came and went with the puffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was breathing hard. His face was burning hot. He hated conflicts,
      fights; hated them so deeply, felt so inadequate when himself involved,
      that emotion usually overcame him. Therefore he fought rather frequently,
      and, on occasions, rather effectively. Emotion will win a fight as often
      as reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered getting Humphrey to one side, making him listen to reason.
      He dwelt on the phrase. The mere thought of Mildred being driven back into
      that house, into the hands of her legal husband, stirred that tendency to
      sob. He set his teeth on it. They could take her back to the rooms. He
      would move out. For that matter, if it would save her reputation, they
      could both move out. At once. But would it save her reputation?
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his hat; pressed a hand to his forehead; then fussed with his
      little moustache. Then, as a new thought was born in his brain, born of
      his emotions, he gave a little start. He looked back at the shadowy group
      about the Ames's horse block. Apparently they hadn't moved. He looked at
      his shoes, tennis shoes with rubber soles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid hat and stick on the ground by a tree; went little way up the
      street, past the circle of the corner light and slipped across; moved
      swiftly, keeping on the grass, around to the alley, came in at the
      Henderson's back gate, made his way to the side steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a door here that led into an entry. There were doors to kitchen
      and dining-room on right and left, and the back stairs. Henry knew the
      house. Kitchen and dining-room were both dark now, but the lights were on
      in parlour and hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He got the screen door open without a sound and felt his way into and
      through the dining-room. It seemed to him that there were a great many
      chairs in that diningroom. His shins bumped them. They met his outspread
      hands. Between this room and the parlour the sliding doors were shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood a moment by these doors, wondering if Arthur V. Henderson was
      still sitting on the top step with his back to the front screen door.
      Probably. He couldn't very well move without some noise. But it would be
      impossible to see him out there, with the parlour light on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Deliberately, with extreme caution, her slid back one of the doors. It
      rumbled a little. He waited, keeping back in the dark, and listened. There
      was no sound from the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The piano stood against the side wall, near the front. On it lay
      Humphrey's straw hat. Any one by merely looking into it could have seen
      the initials. And the man on the steps had only to turn his head and look
      in through the bay window to see piano, hat, and any one who stood near,
      any one, in fact, in that diagonal half of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry held his breath and stepped in, nearly to the centre of the room.
      Here he hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then beginning slowly, not unlike the sound of a wagon rolling over a
      distant bridge, a rumbling fell on his ears. It grew louder. It ended in a
      little bang.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      Henry glanced behind him. The sliding door had closed. There was a
      scuffling of feet on the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry reached up and switched off the electric lamp in the chandelier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stepped forward, found the piano, felt along the top, closed his
      fingers on the hat, and stood motionless. His first thought was that he
      would probably be shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were steps on the porch. The front door opened and closed. Mr
      Henderson was standing in the hall now, but not in the parlour doorway.
      Probably just within the screen door. The hall light put him at a
      disadvantage; and he couldn't turn it out without crossing that parlour
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's there!' Mr Henderson's voice was quiet enough. It sounded tired,
      and nervous. 'Come out o' there quick! Whoever you are!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was silent. He wasn't particularly frightened. Not now. He even felt
      some small relief. But he was confronted with some difficulty in deciding
      what he ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come out O' there!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Henry replied: 'All right.' And came to the hall doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson was leaning a little forward, fists clenched, ready for a
      spring. He still had the cigar in his mouth. But he dropped back now and
      surveyed the youth who stood, white-faced, clasping a straw hat tightly
      under his left arm. He seemed to find it difficult to speak; shifted the
      cigar about his mouth with mobile lips. He even thrust his hands into his
      pockets and looked the youth up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I came for this hat,' said Henry. 'It was on the piano.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mr Henderson's eyes searched him up, and down. Eyes that would be
      sleepy again as soon as this little surprise was over. And they were red,
      with puffs under them. He was a tall man, with big athletic shoulders and
      deep chest, but with signs of a beginning corpulence, the physical laxity
      that a good many men fall into who have been athletes in their teens and
      twenties but are now getting on into the thirties.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was understood here and there in Sunbury that he had times of drinking
      rather hard. Indeed, the fact had been dwelt on by one or two tolerant or
      daring souls who ventured to speak a word for his wife. She had always
      quickly and willingly given her services as pianist at local
      entertainments. Perhaps because, with all her brisk self-possession, she
      must have been hungry for friends. She played exceptionally well, with
      some real style and with an almost perverse touch of humour. She was
      quick, crisp, capable. She disliked banality. To the initiated her playing
      of Chopin was a joy. The sentimentalists said that she had technique but
      no feeling. She could really play Bach. And I think she was the most
      accomplished accompanist that ever lived in Sunbury; certainly the best
      within my memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say'&mdash;thus Mr Henderson now&mdash;'you're Henry Calverly, aren't
      you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'd like to know what you're doing here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you. I came for this hat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Your hat?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Didn't you see the initials?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I noticed the hat there. Why didn't you come in the front way? What's
      all this burglar business?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry didn't answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll have to ask you to answer that question. You seem to forget that
      this is my house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I don't forget that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson took out his cigar; turned it in his fingers. Colour came to
      his face. He spoke abruptly, in a suddenly rising voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Seems to me there's some mighty queer goings-on around here. Sneaking in
      at two in the morning!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It isn't two in the morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dam' near it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It isn't half-past one. I tell you&mdash;&mdash;' Henry paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      His position seemed rather weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson studied his cigar again. He drew a cigar case from an inside
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know's I offered you one,' he said. He almost muttered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't smoke,' said Henry shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson resumed the excited tone. It was curious coming in that jumpy
      way. Even Henry divined the weakness back of it and grew calmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been out on&mdash;&mdash;' He paused. Mildred had trained him not to
      use the phrase, 'on the road.' He resumed with, '&mdash;on a business
      trip. More'n a month. I swan, I'm tired out. Way trains and country
      hotels. Fierce! If I seem nervous.... Look here, you seem pretty much at
      home! Perhaps you'll tell me where my wife is!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry considered this. Shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Trying to make me think you don't know, eh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I do know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson knit his brows over this. Then, instead of immediately
      pressing the matter, he took out a fresh cigar and lighted it with the
      butt of the old one.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Seems to me you ought to tell me,' he said then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's queer, ain't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it's true. I can't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She wrote me that she had Corinne Doag visiting here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. She's here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'With my wife? Now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry bowed. He felt confused, and more than a little tired. And he
      disliked this man, deeply. Found him depressing. But outwardly&mdash;he
      didn't himself dream this&mdash;he presented a picture of austere dignity.
      An effect that was intensified, if anything, by his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anybody else with her and Corinne?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' Henry was finding him disgusting now. But he must be extremely
      careful. An unnecessary word might hurt Mildred or Humphrey. Good old
      Hump!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson turned the fresh cigar round and round, looking intently at
      it. In a surprisingly quiet manner he asked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why doesn't she come home?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry looked at the man. Anger swelled within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because you're here?' He bit the sentence off.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt stifled. He wanted to run out, past the man, and breathe in the
      cool night air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson looked up, then down again at the cigar. Then he pushed open
      the screen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'May as well sit down and talk this over,' he said. 'Cooler on the porch.
      Dam' queer line o' talk. You're young, Calverly. You don't know life. You
      don't understand these things. My God! When I think... Well, what is it?
      You seem to be in on this. Speak out! Tell me what she wants. That's one
      thing about me&mdash;I'm straight out. Fair and square. Give and take. I'm
      no hand for beating about the bush. Come on with it. What does she think I
      ought to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't tell you what she thinks.' Henry was downright angry now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes! It's easy for you! You haven't been through...' His face seemed
      to be working. And his voice had a choke in it. 'But how could a kid like
      you understand I How could you know the way you get tied up and... all the
      little things... My God, man! It hurts. Can you understand that. It's
      tough.' He subsided. Finally, after a long silence, he said huskily but
      quietly, with resignation, 'You'd say I ought to go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I guess I know how to be a sport,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the house, and in a few minutes returned with his suit-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's&mdash;it's sorta like leaving things all at loose ends,' he
      remarked. 'But then&mdash;of course...'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down two or three steps; then paused and looked up at Henry, who
      had risen now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'&mdash;his voice was husky again&mdash;'you staying here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Henry; and walked a way up the street with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Henderson said, rather stiffly, that the hot spell really seemed to be
      over. Been fierce. Especially through Iowa and Missouri. No lake breeze,
      or anything like that. Muggy all the time. That was the thing here in
      Sunbury&mdash;the lake breeze.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      They were still in front of the Ames place. But Mildred had risen. They
      stood watching him as he came, carrying the hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where on earth have you been?' asked Corinne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry met with difficulty in replying. He was embarrassed, caught in an
      uprush of self-consciousness. He couldn't see why there need be talk. He
      gave Humphrey his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How'd you get this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You went in?' This from Mildred. He felt her eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you&mdash;you must have...'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's gone.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gone!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But where?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did you tell him?' asked Corinne sharply'.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing. I don't think I did. Nothing much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, he acted funny. I wouldn't tell him where Mildred was. Then he
      asked why you didn't come home and I said because he was there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred and Corinne looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what made him go?' asked Corinne.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know. He wanted to know what you wanted him to do, Mildred. Of
      course I couldn't say anything to that. And then he said he guessed he
      knew how to be a sport, and went and got his suit-case.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hope he had sense enough not to go to the hotel,' Corinne mused, aloud.
      'They'd talk so.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a train back to Chicago at two-something,' said Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved slowly toward the house. At the steps they paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The university clock struck two.
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened. The reverberations of the second stroke died out. The maple
      leaves overhead rustled softly. From the beach, a block away, came the
      continuous low sound of little waves on shelving sand. The great lake that
      washes and on occasions threatens the shore at Sunbury had woven, from
      Henry's birth, a strand of colour in the fibre of his being. He felt the
      lake as deeply as he felt the maples and oaks of Sunbury; memories of its
      bars of crude' wonderful colour at sunset and sunrise, of its soft mists,
      its yellow and black November storms, its reaches of glacier-like
      ice-hills in winter, of moonlit evenings with a girl on the beach when the
      romance of youth shimmered in boundless beautiful mystery before
      half-closed eyes&mdash;these were an ever-present element in the
      undefined, moody ebb and flow of impulse, memory, hope, desire and
      spasmodic self-restraint that Henry would have referred to, if at all, as
      his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's late enough,' said Corinne, with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred turned away, placed a tiny foot on the bottom step, sighed, then
      murmured, very low, 'Hardly worth while going in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let's not,' muttered Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen.' Thus Corinne. She was leaning against the railing, with an
      extraordinarily graceful slouch. She had never looked so pretty, Henry
      thought. A little of the corner light reached her face, illuminating her
      velvet clear skin and shining on her blue black hair where it curved over
      her forehead. She made you think of health and of wild things. And she
      could, even at this time, earn her living. There was an offer now to tour
      the country forty weeks with a lyceum concert company. The letter had come
      to-day; Henry had seen it. She thought she wouldn't accept. Her idea was
      another year to study, then two or three years abroad and, possibly, a
      start in the provincial opera companies of Italy, Austria, and Germany.
      Yes, she had character of the sort that looks coolly ahead and makes
      deliberate plans. Despite her wide, easy-smiling mouth and her great
      languorous black eyes and her lazy ways, eyen Henry could now see this
      strength in her face, in its solid, squared-up framework. More than any
      girl Henry had ever known she could do what she chose. Men pursued her, of
      course. All the time. There were certain extremely persistent ones. And it
      came quietly through, bit by bit, that she knew them pretty well, knocked
      around the city with them, as she liked. But now she had chosen himself.
      No doubt about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen. Let's go down to the shore and watch for the sunrise. We couldn't
      sleep a wink after&mdash;after this&mdash;anyway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nobody'd ever know,' breathed Mildred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey took her arm. They moved slowly down the walk toward the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne, still leaning there, looked at Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached toward her, but she evaded him and waltzed slowly away over the
      grass, humming a few bars of the <i>Myosotis</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's eyes followed her. He felt the throbbing again in his temples, and
      his cheeks burned. He compressed his lips. He moved after her. He was in a
      state of all but ungovernable excitement, but the elation of two hours
      back had gone, flattened out utterly. He felt deeply uncomfortable. It was
      the sort of ugly moment in which he couldn't have faced himself in a
      looking-glass. For Henry had such moments, when, painfully bewildered by
      the forces that nature implants in the vigorously young, he loathed
      himself. Life opened, a black precipice, before him, yet Life, in other
      guise, drove him on. As if intent on his destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hung back; let Corinne glide on just ahead of him, still slowing
      revolving, swaying, waltzing to the soft little tune she was so musically
      humming. He wanted to watch her; however great his discomfort of the
      spirit, to exult in her physical charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the earlier occasion when she had overtaxed his emotional capacity he
      had got out of it by using the forces she stirred in him as a stimulant.
      But now he wasn't stimulated. Not, at least, in that way. His spirit
      seemed to be dead. Only his body was alive. All the excitement of the
      evening had played with cumulative force on his nerves. He had arrived at
      an emotional crisis; and was facing it sullenly but unresistingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picture of Mildred and Humphrey lost in each other's gaze&mdash;in the
      window-seat at the rooms, on the Ames's horse block&mdash;kept coming up
      in his mind. He could see them in the flesh, walking on ahead, arm in arm,
      but still more vividly he could see them as they had been before he went
      back to Mildred's house. He knew that love had come to them. He wondered,
      trembling with the excitement of the mere thought, how it would seem to
      live through that miracle. No such magic had fallen upon him.. Not since
      the days of Ernestine. And that had been pretty youthful business. This
      matter of Corinne was quite different. He sighed. Then he hurried up to
      her, gripped her arm, walked close beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beach they paired off as a matter of course. Henry and Corinne sat
      in the shadow of a breakwater. Humphrey and Mildred walked on to another
      breakwater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne made herself comfortable with her head resting on Henry's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking, 'Sort of thing you dream of without ever expecting it
      really. Ain't a fellow' in town that wouldn't envy me.' But gloom was
      settling over his spirit like a fog. It seemed to him that he ought to be
      whispering skilful little phrases, close to her ear. He couldn't think of
      any.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over her face; looked into it; smoothed her dusky hair away from
      her temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began humming: 'I arise from dreams of thee.' She picked it up, very
      softly, in a floating, velvety pianissimo.
    </p>
    <p>
      His own voice died out. He couldn't sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt almost despondent. What was the matter with him! Time passed. Now
      and then she hummed other songs&mdash;bits of Schumann and Franz.
      Schubert's <i>Serenade</i> she sang through.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sing with me,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. 'Sometimes I feel like singing, and sometimes I don't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't I make you feel like singing, Henry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, sure!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're a moody boy, Henry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, I'm moody.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She closed her eyes. He watched the dim vast lake for a while; then
      finding her almost limp in his arms, bent again over her face. 'I'm a
      fool,' he thought. He could have sobbed again. He bit his lip. Then kissed
      her. It was the first moment he had been able to. Her hand slipped over
      his shoulder; her arm tightened about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abruptly he stopped; raised his head, a bitter question in his eyes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      A faint light was creeping over the bowl-like sky. And a fainter colour
      was spreading upward from the eastern horizon. The thousands of night
      stars had disappeared, leaving only one, the great star of the morning. It
      sent out little points of light, like the Star of the East in Sunday
      school pictures. It seemed to stir with white incandescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry straightened up; gently placed Corinne against the breakwater;
      covered his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She considered him from under lowered eyelids. Her face was
      expressionless. She didn't smile. And she wasn't singing now. She smoothed
      out her skirt, rather deliberately and thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Think of it!' Henry broke out with a shudder. 'It's a dreadful thing
      that's happened!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It might be,' said Corinne very quietly, 'if Arthur didn't have the sense
      to take that train.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And we're sitting here as if&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen! What on earth made you go back to the house?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't tell you. I don't know. I <i>had</i> to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm! You certainly did it. You're not lacking courage, Henry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said nothing to this. He didn't feel brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mildred was foolish. She shouldn't have let herself get so stirred up.
      She ought to have gone back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can you say that! Don't you see that she <i>couldn't</i>!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I saw that she couldn't. But it was a mistake.' Henry was up on his
      knees, now, digging sand and throwing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was love,' he said hotly&mdash;'real love.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a wreck,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It can't be. If they love each other!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'This town won't care how much they love each other. And there are other
      things. Money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bah! What's money!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a lot. You've got to have it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Haven't you any ideals, Corinne?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She reflected. Then said, 'Of course.' And added: 'She had Arthur where
      she wanted him. That's why he went away, of course. He thought she'd
      caught him. Now she's lost her head and let him get away. Dished
      everything. No telling what he'll do when he finds out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He mustn't find out.' Henry was not aware of any inconsistency within
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He will if she's going to lose her head like this. There are some things
      you have to stand in this world. One of the things Mildred had to stand
      was a husband.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how could she go back to him&mdash;to-night&mdash;feeling this way?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She should have.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're cynical.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm practical. Do you want her to go through a divorce, and then marry
      Humphrey? That'll take money. It's a luxury. For rich folks.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't say such things, Corinne!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not. She's made the break with Arthur. Now the next thing's got to
      happen. What's it to be?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry got to his feet. He gazed a long time at the morning star.
    </p>
    <p>
      The university clock struck three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry shivered..
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come,' he said. 'Let's get back.' It didn't occur to him to help her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four of them lingered a few moments at Mildred's door. Humphrey
      finally led Mildred in. For a last goodnight, plainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corinne smiled at Henry. It was an odd, slightly twisted smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'After all,' she murmured, 'there's no good in taking things too
      seriously.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw out his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You think I'm hard,' she said, still with that smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't! Please!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;good-night. Or good-morning.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him her hand. He took it. It gripped his firmly, lingeringly. He
      returned the pressure; coloured; gripped her hand hotly; moved toward her,
      then sprang away and dropped her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;Henry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sorry. I don't know what's the matter with me. I was looking at that
      star&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I saw you looking at it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was thinking how white it was. And bright. And so far away. As if there
      wasn't any use trying to reach it. And then&mdash;oh, I don't know&mdash;Mr
      Henderson made me blue, the way he looked to-night. And Humphrey and
      Mildred&mdash;the awful fix they're in. And you and me&mdash;I just can't
      tell you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're telling me plainly enough,' she said wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you ever hate, yourself?'
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn't answer this. Or look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did you ever feel that you might turn out just&mdash;oh well, no good? Mr
      Henderson made me think that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He isn't much good,' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      'As if your life wasn't worth making anything out of? Your friends ashamed
      of you? They talk about me here now. And I haven't been bad. Not yet. Just
      one or two little things.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lips formed the words, in the dark, 'You're not bad.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said, rather sharply: 'Don't stand there looking like a whipped
      dog, Henry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll go,' he said; and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You re the strangest person I ever knew,' she said. 'Maybe you <i>are</i>
      a genius. Considering that Mildred completely lost her nerve, your
      handling of Arthur came pretty near being it. I wonder.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey and Mildred came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came straight to him; gave him both her hands. 'You've settled
      everything for us. Humphrey, I want to kiss Henry. I'm going to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry received the kiss like an image. Then he and Humphrey went away
      together into the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No good going to the rooms now,' Humphrey remarked. 'Let's walk the
      beach.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded dismally.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      The sky out over the lake was a luminous vault of deep rose shading off
      into the palest pink. The flat surface of the water, as far as they could
      see, was like burnished metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry flung out a trembling arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look!' he said huskily. 'That star.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still incandescent, still radiating its little points of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump,' he said, a choke in his voice&mdash;'I'm shaken. I'm beginning
      life again to-night, to-day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm shaken too, Hen. The real thing has come. At last. It's got me. It'll
      be a fight, of course. But we're going through with it. I want you to come
      to know her better, Hen. Even you&mdash;you don't know. She's wonderful.
      She's going to help with my work in the shop, help me do the real things,
      creative work, get away from grubbing jobs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment of flashing insight for Henry. He couldn't reply; couldn't
      even look at his friend. His misgivings were profound. Yet the thing was
      done. Humphrey's life had taken irrevocably a new course. No good even
      wasting regrets on it. So he fell, in a tumbling rush of emotion, to
      talking about himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm beginning again. I&mdash;I let go a little. Hump, I can't do it. It's
      too strong for me. I go to pieces. You don't know. I've got to fight&mdash;all
      the time. Do the things I used to do&mdash;make myself work hard, hard.
      Keep accounts. Every penny. Leave girls alone. It means grubbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can't bear to think of it.' He spread out his hands. 'In some ways it
      seems to help to let go. You know&mdash;stirs me. Brings the Power. Makes
      me want to write, create things. But it's too much like burning the candle
      at both ends.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey got out his old cob pipe, and carefully scraped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's probably just what it is,' he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Hump, what is it makes us feel this way! You know&mdash;girls, and
      all that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey lighted his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't know how it makes me feel to see you and Mildred. Just the way
      she looks. And you. Corinne and I don't look like that. We were flirting.
      I didn't mean it. She didn't, either. It's been beastly. But still it
      didn't seem beastly all the time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It wasn't,' said Humphrey, between puffs. 'Don't be too hard on yourself.
      And you haven't hurt Corinne. She likes you. But just the same, she's only
      flirting. She'd never give up her ambitions for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's something I want to feel. Something wonderful. I've been thinking
      of it, looking at that star. I want to love like&mdash;like that. Or
      nothing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey leaned on the railing over the beach, and smoked reflectively.
      The rose tints were deepening into scarlet and gold. The star was fading.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen,' said Humphrey, speaking out of a sober reverie, 'I don't know that
      I've ever seen anybody reach a star. Our lives, apparently, are passed
      right here on this earth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry couldn't answer this. But he felt himself in opposition to it. His
      hands were clenched at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I begin my life to-day,' he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But back of this' determination, like a dark current that flowed silently
      but irresistibly out of the mists of time into the mists of other time, he
      dimly, painfully knew that life, the life of this earth, was carrying him
      on. And on. As if no resolution mattered very much. As if you couldn't
      help yourself, really.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his mouth. And thrust out his chin a little. He had not read
      Henley's <i>Invictus</i>. It would have helped him, could he have seen it
      just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let's walk,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They breakfasted at Stanley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was a constant clattering of dishes and a smell of food. People
      drifted in and out&mdash;men who worked along Simpson Street, and a few
      family groups&mdash;said 'Good-morning. Looks like a warm day.' Picked
      their teeth. Paid their checks to Mrs Stanley at the front table, or had
      their meal tickets punched.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked slowly up the street as far as the Sunbury House corner, and
      crossed over to the <i>Voice</i> office. Each glanced soberly at the hotel
      as they passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went in through the railing that divided front and rear offices.
      Humphrey took off his coat and dropped into his swivel chair before the
      roll-top desk. Henry took off his and dropped on the kitchen chair before
      the littered pine table. Jim Smith, the foreman, came in, his bare arms
      elaborately tattooed, chewing tobacco, and told 'a new one,' sitting on
      the corner of Henry's table. Henry sat there, pale of face, toying with a
      pencil, and wincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Jim had gone, Henry sat still, gazing at the pencil, wondering
      weakly if the rough stuff of life was too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced over toward the desk. Humphrey, pipe in mouth, was already at
      work. Hump had the gift of instant concentration. Even this morning, after
      all that had happened, he was hard at it. Though he had something to work
      for.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sob was near. Henry had to close his eyes for a moment. His sensitive
      lips quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey would be, seeing his Mildred again at the close of the day. Henry
      found himself entertaining the possibility of crawling shamefacedly around
      to Corinne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he sat up stiffly. Felt in one pocket after another until he found a
      little red account-book. He hadn't made an entry for a week. Before
      Corinne came into his life he hadn't missed an entry for nearly two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat staring at it, pencil in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mouth set again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Bkfst. Stanleys... 20c.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped the book into his pocket; compressed his lips for an instant;
      then reached for a wad of copy paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      And gave a little sigh of relief. It was to be a long, perhaps an endless
      battle with self. But he had started.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>iss Amelia
      Dittenhoefer was a figure in Sunbury. She had taught two generations of
      its young in the old Filbert Avenue school. And during more than ten
      years, since relinquishing that task, she had supplied the 'Society,'
      'Church Doings,' 'Woman's Realm,' and 'Personal Mention' departments of
      the <i>Voice</i> with their regular six to eight columns of news and
      gossip.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as several hundred Sunbury men and women had once been her boys and
      girls, this sort of personal news came to her from every side. Her
      'children,' of whatever present age, accepted her as an institution, like
      the university building, General Grant, or Lake Michigan. She never had a
      desk in the <i>Voice</i> office, but worked at home or moving briskly
      about the town. Home, to her, was the rather select, certainly high-priced
      boarding-house of Mrs Clark on Simpson Street, over by the lake, where she
      had lived, at this time, for twenty-one or twenty-two years. She was
      little, neat, precise, and doubtless (as I look back on those days)
      equipped for much more important work than any she ever found to do in
      Sunbury. But Woman's sun had hardly begun to rise then.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Henry had been, at the age of six, one of her boys, and during the past
      two years had shared with her the reporting work of the <i>Voice</i>, it
      was not unnatural that she should stop him as he was hurrying, airily
      twirling his thin bamboo stick, over to Stanley's restaurant. It was
      noontime. Simpson Street was quiet. They walked along past Donovan's drug
      store and Jackson's book store (formerly B. F. Jones's) and turned the
      corner. Here, in front of an unfrequented photographer's studio, Miss
      Dittenhoefer stated her problem. She looked, though her trim little person
      was erect as always, rather beaten down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr Boice has taken half my work, Henry&mdash;&ldquo;Church Doings&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;Society.&rdquo; He sent me a note. I gather that you're to do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me?' Henry spoke in honest amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Doubtless. He's cutting down expenses. I mind, of course, after all these
      years. I've worked very hard. And on the money side, I shall mind a
      little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't mean&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes. Half the former wage. And they don't pension old teachers in
      Sunbury. But this is what I want to tell you&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but Miss Dittenhoefer, I don't&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Never mind, Henry; it's done. Of course I shouldn't have said as much as
      this. Though perhaps I had to say it to somebody. Forget what you can of
      it. But now&mdash;I wanted to give you this list. There's a good lot of
      society for summer. Never knew the old town to be so gay. Two or three
      things in South Sunbury that are important. They feel that we've been
      slighting them down there this year. I've noted everything down. And I've
      written the church societies, asking them to send announcements direct to
      the office after this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't want your work,' said Henry, colouring up. 'It ain't&mdash;isn't&mdash;square.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it's business, Henry. Mr. Boice explained that in his note. You'll
      find I've written everything out in detail&mdash;all my plans and the
      right ladies to see. Good-bye now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, pained, unable to believe that Miss Dittenhoefer's day could pass
      so abruptly, walked moodily back to Stanley's and, as usual, bolted his
      lunch. The unkindness to Miss Dittenhoefer directly affected himself. It
      meant still more of the routine desk-work and more running around town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, slowly, as he sat there staring at the pink mosquito-bar that was
      gathered round the chandelier, his eyes filled. It was hard to believe
      that even Mr Boice could do a thing like that to Miss Dittenhoefer. Coolly
      cutting her pay in half! It seemed to Henry wanton cruelty. It suggested
      to his sensitive mind other tales of cruelty&mdash;tales of the boys who
      had gone into Chicago wholesale houses for their training and had found
      their fresh young dream-ideals harshly used in the desperate struggle of
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, I am certain, thought of Mr Boice at this moment with about as much
      sympathy as a native of a jungle village might feel for a man-eating
      tiger. That look about Miss Dittenhoefer's mouth when she smiled! It was a
      world, this of placid-appearing Sunbury and the big city, just below the
      town line, in which men fought each other to the death, in which young
      boys were hardened and coarsened and taught to kill or be killed, in which
      women were tortured by hard masters until their souls cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boice, I am sure, sensed nothing of this somewhat morbid hostility. No;
      until Robert A. McGibbon turned up in Sunbury, Mr Boice had some reason to
      feel settled and complacent in his years. His private funds were secure in
      his wife's name. And he had every reason to believe that, before many
      months more, it would be his privilege and pleasure to run McGibbon out of
      town for good. If the matter of Miss Dittenhoefer should, for a little
      while, stir up sentimental criticism, why&mdash;well, it was business.
      Sound business. And you couldn't go back of sound business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sighed, got slowly up, had his meal ticket punched at the desk by
      Mrs Stanley, went back to the office.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sunny, listless July day was at its lowest ebb&mdash;when men who had
      the time dawdled and smoked late over their lunch, when ladies took naps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flies crawled languidly about the speckled walls of the <i>Voice</i>
      office. Outside the screen door and the plate-glass front window, the hot
      air, rising from the cement sidewalk, quivered so that the yellow outlines
      of the Sunbury House across the street wavered unstably, and the dusty
      trees over there wavered, and the men sitting coatless, suspendered, in
      the yellow rocking chairs on the long veranda, wavered. Through the open
      press-room door came the sound of one small job-press rumbling at a
      handbill job; the other presses were still. The compositors worked or
      idled without talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here in the office, Henry, tipped back in his kitchen chair before the
      inkstained, cluttered pine table by the end wall, coat off, limp wet
      handkerchief tucked carefully around his neck inside the collar, chewed a
      pencil, gazing now at the little pile of blank copy paper before him, now
      at a discouraged fly on the wall. Gradually the fly took on a perverse
      interest among his wandering, unhappy thoughts. Prompted, doubtless, by a
      sense of inner demoralisation that was now close to recklessness, he
      reached for a pen, filled it with ink, and shot a scattering volley at the
      slow-moving insect.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the roll-top desk by the press-room door, Humphrey Weaver, also
      coatless, cob pipe in mouth, long lean face wrinkled in the effort to keep
      his usually docile mind on its task, elbow on desk and long fingers spread
      through damp hair, was correcting proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice's desk, up in the front window, outside the railing, stood
      vacant. The proprietor might or might not stop in on the early-afternoon
      trip from his house on Upper Chestnut Avenue to the post-office. Mr Boice
      could do as he liked. His time was his own. He lived on the labour of
      others. A fact which often stirred up in Henry's breast a rage that was
      none the less bitter because it was impotent. It was the sort of thing, he
      felt, in his more nearly lucid moments, that you have to stand&mdash;the
      wall against which you must beat your head year after year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, victorious over the fly, settled back. He tried to work. Then sat
      for a time brooding. Then, finally, turned to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump,' he said, 'I&mdash;I know you wouldn't think I had much to do&mdash;I
      mean the way you get work done&mdash;I don't know what it is&mdash;but I
      wish I could see a way to begin on all this new work. I know I'm no good,
      but&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't say that.' Humphrey, glad of a brief respite, settled back in
      his swivel chair. 'I could never have written that picnic story. Never in
      the world. We're different, that's all. You're a racer; I'm a work-horse.
      I don't know just what it's coming to. He isn't handling you right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's it!' Henry cried, softly, eagerly. 'He <i>isn't!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you know now about Miss Dittenhoefer.' Henry's head bowed in
      assent. 'I didn't have the heart to tell you myself, Hen.' He picked up
      his proofs, then looked up and out of the window. 'There,' he remarked
      unexpectedly, 'is a pretty girl!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry turned with the quickness of long habit. 'Where?' he asked, then
      discovered the young person in question standing on the hotel veranda
      talking with Mrs B. L. Ames and Mary Ames.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a new girl. Even now, though Henry had given up girls for good,
      she caused a quickening of his pulse. She <i>was</i> pretty&mdash;rather
      slender, in a blue skirt and a trim white shirt-waist, and an unusual
      amount of darkish hair that massed effectively about a face, the principal
      characteristics of which, at this distance and through the screen door,
      was a bright, almost eager smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a not uninteresting fact, to those who know something of Henry's
      susceptibility on previous occasions, that his gaze wandered moodily back
      to his table. He sighed. His hand strayed up and began pulling at his
      little moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You haven't told me what I'm to do about it, Hump. This society thing
      really stumps me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't known quite what to say. That's all, Hen. The old man is riding
      you, of course. I didn't think, when he raised you to twelve a week, that
      he'd just lie down and pay it. Meekly. Not he! He's a crafty old duck.
      Very, very crafty&mdash;Cheese it; here he comes!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow of Norton P. Boice fell across the door-step. The screen door
      opened with a squeak, and ponderously the quietly dominating force of
      Simpson Street, came in, inclined his massive head in an impersonal
      greeting, and lowered his huge bulk into his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry!' called Mr Boice in his quietly husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man quivered slightly, but sat motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry!' came the husky voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      There could be no pretending not to hear. Henry went over there. Mr Boice
      sat still&mdash;he could; do that&mdash;great hands resting on his
      barrel-like thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am rearranging the work of the paper&mdash;' he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' muttered Henry, not without sullenness; 'I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's a little more for you to do. You'll have to get it cleaned up
      well ahead of time this week. Thursday is the fiftieth anniversary of the
      founding of Sunbury. You'll have to cover that. Take down what you can of
      the speeches.'
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to be all. Henry moved slowly back to the table. After a
      little shuffling about of the papers on his desk, Mr Boice moved heavily
      out and headed toward the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, and not before, Henry rummaged under a pile of exchanges at the rear
      of the table until he found a book. This he held close to his body, where
      it would not be seen should Humphrey turn unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was entitled <i>Will Power and Self Mastery</i>. Opposite the
      title page was a half-tone reproduction of the author&mdash;a face with a
      huge moustache and intensely knit brows. Henry studied it, speculating in
      a sort of despair as to whether he could ever bring himself to look like
      that. He knit his own brows. His hand strayed again to his own downy
      moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the pages. Read a sentence here and there. The book, though
      divided under various chapter headings, was really made up of hundreds of
      more or less pithy little paragraphs. These paragraphs&mdash;their
      substance mainly a rehandling of the work of Samuel Smiles, James Parton,
      and the Christian and Mental Scientists (though Henry didn't know this)&mdash;might
      easily have been shuffled about and arranged in other sequence, so little
      continuity of thought did they represent. One paragraph ran:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The express train of Opportunity stops but once at your station. If you
      miss it, it will never again matter that you almost caught it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another was&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Practise concentration. Fix your mind on the job in hand. Aim to do it a
      little better than such a job was ever done before. It is related of
      Thomas Alva Edison that, at the early age of seven, he&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how many a young man, standing at the parting of life's main roads,
      has lost for ever the golden opportunity because he stopped to light a
      cigarette!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry replaced the book under the pile of exchanges. A copy of last week's
      <i>Voice</i> lay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time he had let an issue of the paper go by without
      reading and re-reading every line of his own work. But he had, during
      these five days, passed through one of life's great revolutions. Besides,
      he had been put on a salary basis. When on space-rates, it had been
      necessary to cut everything out and paste it up into a 'string' for
      measurement. It came to him now, with a warm little uprush of memory, that
      the best piece of writing he had ever done would be in this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the paper. There was his story, occupying all of page three that
      wasn't given up to advertisements. This was better than working. Besides,
      he ought to go over it. He settled down to it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sound that caused Humphrey to start up in surprise was the first
      outbreak of profanity he had ever heard from the lips of Henry Calverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was sitting up stiffly, holding last week's <i>Voice</i> with hands
      that distinctly trembled. When Humphrey first looked, he was white, but
      after a moment the colour began flowing back to his face and continued
      flowing until his face was red. His lips were clamped tight, as if the
      small verbal explosion that had just passed them had proved even more
      startling to himself than to Humphrey. 'What is it?' asked the editor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stared at the outspread paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This!' he got out. 'This&mdash;this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's the matter, Hen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you <i>know?</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, your picnic story! Yes&mdash;but&mdash;what on earth is the matter
      with you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You <i>know</i>, Hump! You never told me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean the cuts?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh&mdash;yes!' This 'Oh' was a moan of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good heavens, Hen&mdash;you didn't for a minute think we could print it
      as you wrote it?' Henry's facial muscles moved, but he got no words out.
      Humphrey, touched, went on. 'I don't mind telling you&mdash;between
      ourselves&mdash;that the thing as you wrote it, every word, is the best
      bit of descriptive writing I've seen this year. But you wrote the real
      story, boy. You painted the whole Simpson Street bunch as they are&mdash;every
      wart. It's a savage picture. Why, we'd have dropped seventy per cent, of
      our advertising between Saturday and Monday! And the queer little picture
      of Charlie Waterhouse out behind the lemonade stand&mdash;&mdash; Why,
      boy, that's enough to bust open the town!
    </p>
    <p>
      With Bob McGibbon gunning for Charlie and demanding an accounting of the
      town money! Gee!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry seemed hardly to hear this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who&mdash;who re-wrote it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I did some. The old man polished it off himself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's ruined!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course. But it brought you a raise to twelve a week. That's
      something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't understand. It was my work. And it was true. I wrote the
      truth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's why.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then they don't want the truth?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good lord&mdash;no!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry considered this, bent over as if to read further, twisted his
      flushed face as if in pain, then abruptly sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's become of it&mdash;the piece I wrote?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Hen&mdash;I didn't feel that we had a right to destroy the thing.
      Too dam good! In a sense, it's the old man's property; in another sense,
      it's yours&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's mine!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'In a sense. At any rate, I took it on myself to have a copy made
      confidentially. Then I turned the original over to Mr Boice. He doesn't
      know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where's the copy?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here in my desk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Give it to me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just hold your horses a minute, Hen&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You give it&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey threw up a hand, then opened a drawer. He handed over the
      typewritten manuscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who made this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gertie Wombast. I warned her to keep her mouth shut.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How much did it cost?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, see here, Hen&mdash;I won't talk to you! Not till you get over this
      excitement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not excited. Or, at least&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey gave a shrug. Henry, gripping the roll of manuscript, started
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait a minute, Hen! What do you think you're going to do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you s'pose? Only one thing I <i>can</i> do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Going after the old man?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course! You would yourself, if&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I wouldn't. Not in any such rush as that. It's upsetting to have your
      good work pawed over and cut to pieces, but twelve a week is&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Hump, it's everything! He's made it impossible for me. I could stand
      some of it, but not all this. He ain't fair! He <i>wants</i> to make it
      hard for me! He's just thinking up ways to be mean. And he's spoiled my
      work&mdash;best thing I've ever done in my life! And now people will never
      know how well I can write.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes, they will!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, they won't. I'll never feel just that way again. It's a feeling that
      comes. And then it goes. You can't do anything about it. It was Corinne
      and the way I felt about her. And a lot o' things. Seemed to make me
      different. Lifted me up. I was red-hot.' He reached out and struck the
      paper from the table to the floor. 'You bet I'll go to old Boice! 'I'll
      tell him a thing or two I He'll know something's happened before he gets
      through with me. I've had something to say to him for a good while. Going
      to say it now. Guess he don't know I'll be twenty-one in November. Have a
      little money then. He can't put it over me. I'll buy his old paper. Or
      start another one. I'll make the town too hot for him. Thinks he owns all
      Sunbury. But he <i>don't!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen,' said Humphrey bravely, when the irate youth paused for breath, 'you
      simply must not try to talk to him while you're mad as this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But don't you see, Hump,' cried Henry, his face working with vexation,
      tears close to his eyes; 'it's just the time! When I'm mad. If I wait,
      I'll never say a word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled the manuscript tightly in his hand, bit his lip, then abruptly
      rushed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here,' cried Humphrey. 'Don't you go showing that&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      But the only reply was the noisy slam of the screen door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Face set, eyes wild behind their glasses, Henry hurried down Simpson
      Street toward the post-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Hemple, at the money-order window, said that Mr Boice was having a
      talk with Mr Waterhouse in the back office and wasn't to be disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry turned away. For a little time he studied the weather-chart hanging
      on the wall. He went to the wide front window and gazed out on the street.
      His determination was already oozing away. He found himself slouching and
      straightened up. Repeatedly he had to do this. Four times he went back to
      the money-order window; four times Miss Hemple smiled and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha Caldwell walked by with the two Smith girls. He thought she saw
      him. If so, she carefully avoided a direct glance. They still weren't
      speaking. At least, Martha wasn't. And to think that during three long
      years, except for another episode now and than, she had been his girl!
    </p>
    <p>
      Heigh-ho! No more girls! He was through!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ames's carriage rolled fly. Mary Ames was in it. And&mdash;apparently,
      unmistakably&mdash;the new girl. The girl of the Sunbury House veranda.
      She was chatting brightly. She <i>was</i> pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned mournfully away. She was not for him. Once it might have been
      possible&mdash;back in his gay big days. But not now. Not now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He approached the window for the sixth time. For the sixth time, Miss
      Hemple shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered out to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chance had passed. If the old man should, at this moment, and alone,
      come walking out, he would say meekly, 'Good-afternoon, Mr Boice,' and
      hurry away. He would even try to look busy and earnest. There was shame in
      the thought. His mouth was drooping at the corners. All of him&mdash;body,
      mind, spirit&mdash;was sagging now. He moved, slowly down toward the
      tracks, entered the little lunch-counter place there and ate a thick piece
      of lemon-meringue pie. Which was further weakness. He knew it. It
      completed his depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he must think. He ordered another piece of pie. He wished he
      hadn't said so much to Humphrey. Would he ever learn to control the spoken
      word? Probably not. He sighed. And ate. He couldn't very well go back to
      the office. Not like this&mdash;in defeat. All that work, too I Life,
      work, friendship, all the realities seemed to be slipping from his grasp.
      His thoughts were drifting off into a haze. It was an old familiar mood.
      It had come often during his teens. Not so much lately; but he was as
      helpless before it as he had been at eighteen, when he finally drifted
      aimlessly out of his class at the high school.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days, it had been his habit to wander along the beach, sit on a
      breakwater, let life and love and duty drift by beyond his reach. Thither
      he headed now by a back street. Too many people he knew along Simpson
      Street. Besides, he might be thrown face to face with the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the corner of Filbert Avenue he met the editor and proprietor of the <i>Gleaner</i>.
      He inclined his head with unconscious severity and would have passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Robert A. McGibbon came to a halt, smiled in a thin strained fashion,
      and glanced curiously from Henry's face to the tightly rolled manuscript
      in his hand and back to the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he remarked, 'how's things?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry wanted to be let alone. But he had never deliberately snubbed
      anybody in his life. He couldn't. So he, too, came to a stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, pretty good,' he replied.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      He found himself, in his turn, looking Mr McGibbon over. The man was just
      a little seedy. He had a hand up, rubbing the back of his head under the
      tipped-down straw hat, and Henry noted the shiny black surface of his
      sleeve. He had a freckled, thinly alert face, a little pinched. His hair
      was straight and came down raggedly about ears and collar. Behind his
      gold-rimmed spectacles, small, sharp eyes, very keen, appeared to be
      darting this way and that, restlessly noting everything within their range
      of vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Things going well over at the <i>Voice</i> office?' Henry was silent. He
      couldn't lie. 'Not going so well, eh? That's too bad. Anything special
      up?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Henry, finding his voice untrustworthy; 'nothing special.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What you doing now? Anything much?' Henry shook his head. 'Taking a
      little walk, perhaps.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mind if I walk along with you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;no.'
    </p>
    <p>
      They fell into step.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Been thinking a little about you lately. Wondering if you were happy in
      your work over there.' Henry compressed his lips. 'Did you write the
      Business Men's Picnic story?' Henry was silent. 'Pretty fair job, I
      thought.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was terrible!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no&mdash;not terrible. You're too hard on yourself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm not hard on myself. It's <i>his</i> fault. He spoiled it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who&mdash;Boice? I shouldn't wonder. He could spoil <i>The New York Sun</i>
      in two days, with just a little rope.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He tore it all to pieces. I've got the real story here. I couldn't let
      you see it, of course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon glanced down at the roll of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You like to write, don't you?' Henry nodded shortly. 'Boice won't let you
      do it, I suppose.' Henry shook his head. 'He wouldn't. You know, there
      isn't really any reason why a country paper shouldn't be interesting. Play
      to the subscriber, you know. Boice plays to the advertiser and the county
      printing. Other way takes longer, takes a little more money at first, but
      once you get your subscriber hooked, the advertiser has to follow. Better
      for the long game.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was only half listening. They were crossing the Lake Shore Drive
      now. They stopped at the railing and looked out over the lake. Henry's
      thoughts were darting this way and that, searching instinctively for a
      weak spot in the wall of fate that had closed in on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've got a little money,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, it has its uses.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't quite got it. I get the interest. And they'll have to give me
      all of it in November. The seventh. I'll be twenty-one then.' These words
      seemed to reassure. Henry. 'Yes; I'll be twenty-one. It's quite a little,
      too. Over four thousand dollars. It was my mother's.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's not to be sneezed at,' said McGibbon reflectively. 'If I had four
      thousand right now&mdash;or one thousand, for that matter&mdash;I could
      make sure of turning my corner and landing the old <i>Gleaner</i> on Easy
      Street. I've had a fight with that paper. Been through a few things these
      eight months. But I'm gaining circulation in chunks now. Six months more,
      and I'll nail that gang.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know'&mdash;McGibbon threw a knee up on the railing and lighted a
      cigar&mdash;'it takes money to make money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes&mdash;of course,' said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A thousand dollars now on the <i>Gleaner</i> would be worth ten thousand
      ten years from now.' He smoked thoughtfully. 'I've been watching you,
      Calverly. And if it wasn't so tough on you, I could laugh at old Boice.
      He's got a jewel in you, and he doesn't know it. I suppose he keeps you
      grinding&mdash;correcting proof, running around&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you've no idea!' Henry burst out. 'Everything! Just an awful grind!
      And now he expects me to cover all the &ldquo;Society&rdquo; and &ldquo;Church Doings.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What! How's that? Has he come down on Miss Dittenhoefer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry swallowed convulsively and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's piling it all on me, and I won't stand for it. It ain't right! It
      'ain't fair! And you bet your life he's going to hear a few things from me
      before this day's much older! I'm going to tell him a thing or two!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's right!' said McGibbon. 'He won't respect you any the less for it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed. Henry stood, flushed, breathing hard through set
      teeth, staring out at the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm going to tell you something, Calverly. And it's because I feel that
      you and I are going to be friends. I've known about you, of course. I know
      you can write. You'd do a lot to make a paper readable. Which is what a
      paper has got to be. But now I can see that we're going to be friends.
      You've confided in me. I'm going to confide in you.' He paused, blew out a
      long, meditative arrow of smoke, then added, 'I know a little about that
      story you wrote.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>You</i> do!' McGibbon slowly nodded. 'But how?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You must remember, Calverly, that I'm not like these small-town folks
      around here. I've worked at this game in New York, and I know a thing or
      two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been in New York,' said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great town! But I don't spend my time here in daydreams. I have my lines
      out all over town. There's mighty little going on that I don't know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You seem to know a lot about Charlie Waterhouse.'
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon smiled like a sphinx, then said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've nearly got him. Not quite, but nearly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I don't see how you could know about&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I told you I was going to confide in you. It's simple enough. Gert
      Wombast let her sister read it&mdash;the one that works at the library.
      Swore her to secrecy. And&mdash;well, I board at the Wombasts'&mdash;Look
      here, Calverly: you'd better let me read it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry promptly surrendered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon laid the manuscript on his knee, lighted a fresh cigar, and gazed
      at the lake. Henry, all nerves, was clasping and unclasping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course,' he said, 'this ain't really a finished thing, you understand.
      It's just as I wrote it off&mdash;fast, you know&mdash;and I haven't had a
      chance to correct it or&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon raised his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Calverly&mdash;none of that. This is literature. Of course, old Boice
      couldn't print it. Never in the world. But it's sweet stuff. It's a
      perfect, merciless pen-picture of life on Simpson Street. And those two
      old crooks behind the lemonade stand&mdash;you've opened a jack-pot there.
      If you only knew it, son, that's evidence. Evidence! You walked right into
      it. Charlie Waterhouse is short in his town accounts. I know that. Boice
      and Weston are covering up for him. They work up this neat little purse
      and give it to Charlie. Why? Because he's the most popular man in Sunbury?
      Rot! Because they're helping him pay back. Making the town help.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, do you really think&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Think?&rdquo; I know. This completes the picture. Tell me&mdash;what is Boice
      paying you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twelve a week, now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm! That's quite a little for a country weekly. I could meet it, though,
      if&mdash;see here: What chance is there of your getting, say, a thousand
      of your money free and investing in the <i>Gleaner?</i> Now, wait! I want
      to put this thing before you. It's the turning-point. If we act without
      delay, we've got 'em. We've got everything. We own the town. Here we are!
      The <i>Gleaner</i> is just at the edge of success. I take you over from
      the <i>Voice</i> at the same salary&mdash;twelve a week. I'll give you
      lots of rope. I won't expect routine from you. I'll expect genius. Stuff
      like this. The real thing. Just when it comes to you, and you feel you
      can't help writing. With this new evidence I can go after Charlie
      Waterhouse and break him. I'll finish Boice and Weston at the same time.
      Show up the whole outfit! Whatever'll be left of the <i>Voice</i> by that
      time, Boice can have and welcome. The <i>Gleaner</i> will be the only
      paper in Sunbury.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'My Uncle Arthur is executor of my mother's estate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You go right after him. No time to lose. We must drive this right
      through.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll see him to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Couldn't you find him to-night?'
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur lived in Chicago, out on the West Side. It was a long ride&mdash;first
      by suburban train into the city, then by cable-car through miles upon
      miles of gray wooden tenements and dingy gray-brick tenements. You
      breathed in odours of refuse and smoke and coal-gas all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur was as thin as McGibbon, but wholly without the little gleam
      in the eyes that advertised the proprietor of the <i>Gleaner</i> as an
      eager and perhaps dangerous man. Uncle Arthur was a man of method who had
      worked through long years into a methodical but fairly substantial
      prosperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thin nose was long, and prominent. His brow was deeply furrowed. His
      gaze was critical. He believed firmly that life is a disciplinary training
      for some more important period of existence after death. He didn't smoke
      or drink. Nor would he keep in his employ those who indulged in such
      practices. He was an officer of several organisations aiming at civic and
      social reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur laid a pedantic stress, in all business matters, on what he
      called 'putting the thing right end to.' It was not unnatural, therefore,
      that he should receive a distinctly unfavourable impression when Henry
      began, with a foolish little gesture and a great deal of fumbling at his
      moustache, slouching in his chair, by saying 'There's a little chance come
      up&mdash;oh, nothing much, of course&mdash;for me to make a little money,
      sort of on the side&mdash;and you see I'll be twenty-one in November; so
      it's just a matter of three or four months, anyway&mdash;and I was
      figuring&mdash;oh, just talking the thing over&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice trailed off into a mumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you would take your hand away from your mouth, Henry,' said his uncle
      sharply, 'perhaps I could make out what you're trying to say.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sat up with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, you see, Uncle Arthur, there's a fellow bought the old Sunbury <i>Gleaner</i>
      and he's awfully smart&mdash;got his training in New York&mdash;and he's
      brought the paper already&mdash;why, it ain't eight months!&mdash;to where
      he's right on the point of turning his corner. You see, a thousand dollars
      now may easily be worth ten thousand in a few years. The <i>Voice</i> is a
      rotten paper. Nobody reads the darned thing. And I can't work for old
      Boice, anyhow. He drives me crazy. If he'd just give me half a chance to
      do the kind of thing I can do best once in a while; but this&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry, are you asking me to advance you a thousand dollars of your
      principal?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;well, yes, if&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most certainly not!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, you see, it's so close to November seventh, anyway, that I thought&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You thought that on your twenty-first birthday I would at once close out
      the investments I have made with the money your mother left and hand you
      the principal in cash?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stared at him, his thoughts for the moment frozen stiff. In Uncle
      Arthur's obstructionist attitude, so suddenly revealed, lay the promise of
      a new, wholly undreamed-of disappointment. It was crushing. Then, almost
      in the same second, it was stimulating. Henry's eyes blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean to say&mdash;&mdash;' he began, shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I mean to say that I haven't the slightest intention of letting you
      squander the money your mother so painfully&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's my money!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I'm your uncle and your guardian&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You needn't think you're going to keep that one minute after November
      seventh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will use my judgment. I won't be dictated to by a boy who&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you gotta!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have not got to!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't stand for&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry, I won't have such talk here. I think you had better go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, with a good deal of mumbling, went. He was bewildered. And the
      little storm of indignant anger had shaken him. He returned, during the
      ride back past the tenements on the jerky cable-car, through streets that
      swarmed with noisy, ragged children and frowsy adults and all the smells,
      to depression. McGibbon said that Uncle Arthur's threat to hold the money
      after the seventh of November was a distinct point.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In these matters, unfortunately, where a relative or family friend has
      for years had charge of money belonging to others, little temptations are
      bound to come up. Now, your uncle may be the most scrupulously honest of
      men, but&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He has a bad eye,' Henry put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't doubt it. Calverly, let me tell you&mdash;never forget this&mdash;a
      man who hesitates for one instant to account freely, fully for money is
      never to be trusted.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what can I do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do? Everything! Just what I'm doing with Charlie Waterhouse, for one
      thing&mdash;insist on a full statement.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They framed a letter&mdash;or McGibbon framed it&mdash;demanding an
      accounting, 'in order that further legal measures may not become
      necessary.' McGibbon said he would send it early in the morning,
      registered, and with a special-delivery stamp. 'Later, they decided to add
      emphasis by means of a telegram demanding immediate consideration of the
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night, when Humphrey came upstairs into a pitch-dark living-room
      and switched on the light, he discovered a pale youth sitting stiffly on a
      window-seat wide-awake, eyes staring nervously, hands clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, what on earth?' said he, in mild surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Hump, I've wondered what you'd think&mdash;leaving you in the lurch
      with all that work!
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey threw out a lean hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can manage. Get some help from one of the students. And Gertie Wombast
      is usually available&mdash;&mdash; Oh, say; how about the old man? Did you
      tell him what's what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's burning eyes stared out of that white face. Suddenly&mdash;so
      suddenly that Humphrey himself started&mdash;he sprang up, cried out; 'No!
      No! No!' and rushed into his bedroom, slamming the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey looked soberly at the door, shook his head, filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      That 'No! No! No!' still rang in his ears It was a cry of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey had suffered; but he had never known a turbulence of the sort
      that every now and then seemed to tear Henry to pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Must be fierce,' he thought. 'But it works up as well as down. Runs to
      extremes. Creative faculty, I suppose. Well, he's got it&mdash;that's all.
      And he's only a kid. Thing to do's to stand by and try to steady him up a
      little when he comes out of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And the philosophical Humphrey went to bed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      At noon, no word had come from Uncle Arthur. Henry, all the morning, had
      flitted back and forth between McGibbon's rear office and the telegraph
      office in the 'depot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At twelve-thirty, they sent a peremptory message, demanding a reply by
      three o'clock. An ultimatum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reply came unexpectedly, with startling effect, at twenty-five minutes
      past two, requesting Henry to come directly into his uncle's Chicago
      office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught the two-forty-seven. McGibbon, who had missed nothing of the
      concern on Henry's face at this brisk counter-offensive on the part of
      Uncle Arthur, was with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon waited in the corner drug store while Henry-went up in one of the
      elevators of the great La Salle Street office-building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur led the way into his inner office, closed the door, seated
      himself, and with austerity surveyed the youth before him, taking in with
      deliberate thought the far-from-inexpensive blue-serge suit, the
      five-dollar straw hat, the bamboo stick (which Henry carried anything but
      airily now), and the hopelessly futile little moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit down,' said Uncle Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur opened a drawer, took up two slips of paper, deliberately
      laid them before his nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There,' he said, 'is my cheque for one thousand forty-six dollars and
      twenty-nine cents. It is the value, with interest to this morning, of one
      bond which I am buying from you, at the price given in to-day's
      quotations. Kindly sign the receipt. Right there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He dipped a pen and Henry signed, then, with shaky fingers, picked up the
      cheque, fingered it, laid it down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want no misunderstandings about this, Henry. I am doing it because I
      regard you as a young fool. Perhaps you will be less of a fool after you
      have lost this money. Henry heard the words through a mist of confused
      feelings. 'I will have no more letters and telegrams like these.' He
      indicated the little sheaf of papers on his desk. 'And I won't have my
      character assailed either by you or by any cheap scoundrel whose advice
      you may be taking.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;but he's <i>not</i> a cheap scoundrel!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur raised his eyebrows. His eyes, Henry felt, would burn holes
      in him if he stayed here much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're hard on me, Uncle Arthur. You're not fair I'm <i>not</i> going to
      lose&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      The older man abruptly got up.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you care for any advice at all from me, I suggest that you insist on a
      note from this man&mdash;a demand note, or, at the very outside, a
      three-months' one. Don't put money unsecured into a weak business. Make it
      a personal obligation on the part of the proprietor. And now, Henry, that
      is all. I really don't care to talk to you further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle turned brusquely away.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;but&mdash;' Henry said unsteadily, 'Uncle Arthur&mdash;really!
      Money isn't everything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His uncle turned on him as if about to speak; but on second thought merely
      raised his eyebrows again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came the final humiliation, the little climax that was always to
      stand out with particular vividness in Henry's memory of the scene. He
      turned to go. He had reached the door when he heard his uncle's voice,
      saying, with a rasp:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have forgotten the cheque, Henry'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had to go back for it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7
    </h3>
    <p>
      One effect of the scene was a slight coolness toward McGibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shall want your note,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon turned his head away at this and looked out of the car window.
      Then, a moment later, he replied:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure! Of course! It's just as I told you&mdash;always watch a man who
      hesitates a minute in money matters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Three months,' said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And we can arrange renewals in a friendly spirit between ourselves,' said
      McGibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Sunbury station, Henry drew a little red book from his pocket, knit
      his brows, and said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I owe you for those car fares. Two; wasn't it? Or three?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, shucks! Don't think of that!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Was it two or three?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;if you really&mdash;two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry gave him a dime. Then entered the item in the small book.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that?' asked McGibbon. 'Keep accounts?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes,' Henry replied; 'I'm very careful about money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a good way to be,' said McGibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Gleaner</i> office was over Hemple's meat-market on Simpson Street,
      up a long flight of stairs. Here they paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come up,' said McGibbon jovially, 'and pick out the place for your desk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Henry; 'not now. Got to hurry. But I'll be right over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to hurry, because it was nearly five o'clock, and Mr Boice might be
      gone. And it seemed to Henry to be important that he should have the
      cheque still in his pocket at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were burning again. And his brain was racing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say!' he cried abruptly. 'Look here! Miss Dittenhoefer&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. I think McGibbon, for the first time, really felt the
      emotional power that was unquestionably in Henry. His own quick eyes now
      took on some of that fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great!' he answered. And would have talked on, but Henry had already torn
      away, almost running.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed past the <i>Gleaner</i> office without a glance. It suddenly
      didn't matter whether Mr Boice had gone or not. Henry was a firebrand now.
      He would unhesitatingly trail the man to his home, to the Sunbury Club, to
      Charlie Waterhouse's, even to Mr Weston's. The Power was on him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice had not gone. Even twenty minutes later, when Henry came into the
      office, he was still at his desk. Over it, between the dusty pile of the
      <i>Congressional Record</i> and the heap of ancient zinc etchings, his
      thick gray hair could be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry entered, head erect, tread firm, marched in through the gate in the
      railing to his table, rummaged through the heaps of old exchanges, proofs,
      hand-bills, and programmes for a book that was there, and certain other
      little personal possessions. The two pencils and one penholder were his.
      Also, a small glass inkstand. He gathered these up, made a parcel in a
      newspaper. He felt Humphrey's eyes on him. He heard old Boice move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry!' He went on tying the parcel. 'Henry&mdash;come here!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gotta do it, Hump. Tell you later.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he moved deliberately to the desk out front, rested an elbow on it,
      looked down at the bulky, motionless figure sitting there.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where've you been?' asked Mr Boice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Been attending to my own affairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you expect your work to be done? The fiftieth anniversary of&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't any work here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you haven't?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Through with you. You owe me a little for this week, but I don't want
      it. Wouldn't take it as a gift.' His voice was rising. He could feel
      Humphrey's eyes over the top of his desk. And a stir by the press-room
      door told him that Jim Smith was listening there, with two or three
      compositors crowding pip behind him. 'Not as a gift. It's dirty money. I'm
      through with you. You and your crooked crowd!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you are?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. Through with you. I'm on a decent paper now. A paper that ain't
      afraid to print the truth.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice, still motionless, indulged his only nervous affection, making
      little sounds.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mmm!' he remarked. 'Hmm! Ump! Mmm!' Then he said, 'Meaning the <i>Gleaner</i>,
      I presume.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Meaning the <i>Gleaner</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose you know that McGibbon's slated to fail within the month. He
      can't so much as meet his pay-roll.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know more'n that!' cried Henry, laughing nervously. 'I know he's got
      money because I put some in to-day. Miss Dittenhoefer's quitting you this
      week, too. She's enthusiastic about us. I've just seen her. We're going to
      have a big property there. We'll buy you out one o' these days for a song.
      Then it'll be the <i>Gleaner and Voice</i>. See? But, first, we're going
      to clean up the town. You and Charlie Waterhouse and that-old whited
      sepulchre in the bank! I'll show you you can't fool with me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very youthful. Henry wished, in a swift review, that he had thought
      up something better and rehearsed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw the eyes of the huge, still man waver down to his desk. And
      his heart bounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's afraid of me!' ran his thoughts. 'I've licked him!'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the time to leave. Parcel under arm, he strode out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out on the sidewalk, he laughed aloud. Which wouldn't do. He was a
      business man now. With investments. He mustn't go grinning down Simpson
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was worth a thousand dollars. Just to feel this way once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jim Smith? out of breath, came sidling up to the corner. He had run around
      through the alley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrung Henry's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great!' he cried. 'Soaked it to the old boy, you did! Makes me think of a
      story. Maybe you've heard this one. If you have, just&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand fell on Henry's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Humphrey, hatless. He must have walked out right past Mr Boice. His
      face wrinkled into a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My boy,' he said, 'right here and now I thank you for the joy you've
      brought into my young life. The impossible has happened. The beautifully
      impossible. It was great.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' cried Henry, beaming, unstrung, a touch of nervous aggression in
      his voice, 'I said it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you said it' cried Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Henry closed a door behind him. And treading the air, trying
      desperately to control the upward-twitching corners of his mouth, humming
      the wedding-march from <i>Lohengrin</i> to the familiar words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Here comes the bride&mdash;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Get on to her stride!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &mdash;he marched, a conqueror, down Simpson Street. Yes, it was worth a
      thousand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in the old <i>Voice</i> office, Mr Boice sat motionless, big hands
      sprawling across his thighs, making little sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think he was trying, in his deliberate way, to figure out what had
      happened. But he never succeeded in figuring it out. Not this particular
      incident. He couldn't know that it is as well to face a tigress as an
      artist whose mental offspring you have injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      No; to him, Henry, the boy of the silly little cane and the sillier
      moustache, had stepped out of character. He couldn't know that Henry, the
      drifting, helpless youth, and Henry the blazing artist were two quite
      different persons. In Mr Boice's familiar circles they played duplicate
      whist and talked business, but they were not acquainted with the mysteries
      of dual personality such as appear in the case of any genius, great or
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor (for the excellent reason that he had never heard of William Blake or
      his works) did the immortal line come to mind;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Did He who made the lamb make thee?
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Boice was obliged to give it up.

    <h2>
      VI&mdash;ALADDIN ON SIMPSON STREET
    </h2>
    <h3>
      1
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>lberforce Jenkins
      was the most accomplished very young man-about-town in Sunbury. He
      appeared to have, even at twenty-one, the bachelor gift. He danced well.
      His golf was more than promising. He had lately taken up polo with the
      Dexter Smith boys and young de Casselles. He owned two polo ponies, a
      schooled riding horse, and a carriage team which he drove to a high cart.
      His allowance from his father by far overcame the weakness of his salary
      (he was with his brother, Jefferson, in a bond house on La Salle Street).
      His aptitude at small talk amounted to a gift. He liked, inevitably, the
      play that was popular and (though he read little) the novel that was
      popular. His taste in girls pointed him unerringly toward the most
      desirable among the newest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Henry had been together in high school (Sunbury was democratic
      then). They had played together in the football team. They had&mdash;during
      one hectic month&mdash;been rivals for the hand of Ernestine Lambert.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that instance, in so far as success had come, it had come to Henry. But
      those were Henry's big days, when he was directing <i>Iolanthe</i>, the
      town at his feet. Life, these two years, had flowed swiftly on. The long
      dangling figure of Elbow Jenkins had filled out. His crude boyishness had
      given way to a smiling reserve. He was a young man of the world&mdash;self-assured,
      never indiscreet of tongue, always well-mannered, never individual or
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Henry still worked on Simpson Street. He hadn't struck his gait. He
      was&mdash;if you bothered, these days, to think about him&mdash;a little
      queer. He wore that small moustache and a heavy cord hanging from his
      nose-glasses, and dressed a thought too conspicuously. As if impelled by
      some inner urge to assert a personality that might otherwise be
      overlooked.... As I glance back upon the Henry of this period, it seems to
      me that there was more than a touch of pathos about that moustache. It was
      such a soft little thing. He fussed with it so much, and kept trying to
      twist it up at the ends. He didn't seem to know that they weren't twisting
      moustaches up at the ends that year. In fact, I think he lacked almost
      utterly the gift of conformity which was the strongest, element in Elbow
      Jenkins's nature. And he never acquired it. In education, in work and
      preparation for life, he went it alone, stumbling, blundering, doing
      apparently stupid things, acting from baffling obscure motives, then
      suddenly coming through with an unexpected flash of insight and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the period of Ernestine Lambert to the time of the present story
      Elbow Jenkins had been on Henry's nerves. Whenever they met, that is; or
      when Henry saw him driving the newest, prettiest, best-dressed girl about
      in his cart. Two years earlier he would have had two ponies hitched
      tandem. But now, a little older, less willing to be conspicuous except in
      strict conformity with the conventions, he drove his carefully matched
      team side by side. His scat, his hold of the reins, the very turning-back
      of his tan gloves, all were correct. These, indeed, were details in the
      problem of living and moving about with success among one's fellows that
      Elberforce Jenkins regarded as really important. Like one's stance at
      golf, and cultivating the favour of men who could be influential in a
      business or social way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Elbow was on Henry's nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Elbow had long since forgotten Henry, except for a chance nod now and
      then. And occasionally a moment's annoyance that Henry should insist on
      keeping alive a nickname that had with years and the beginnings of dignity
      become undesirable.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      The blow fell on Henry at half-past five on the Tuesday.
    </p>
    <p>
      I mark the time thus precisely because it perhaps adds a touch of interest
      to the consideration of what happened between then and Friday night, when
      McGibbon first saw what he had done. Of the importance of the blow in
      Henry's life there is no doubt. It turned him sharply Not until he was
      approaching middle life could he look back on the occasion without
      wincing. And while wincing, he would say that it was what he had needed.
      Plainly. That it made a man of him, or started the process.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to that, I can't say. Perhaps it did. Life is not so simple as Henry
      had been taught it was. I am fatalist enough to believe that Henry would
      have become what he was to become in any event, because it was in him. I
      doubt if he could have been given any other direction. Though of course he
      might have gone under simply through a failure to get aroused. Something
      had to start him, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      The practical difficulty with Henry's life was, of course, that he was
      strong. He didn't know this himself. He thought he was weak. Some who
      observed him thought the same. There were reasons enough. But Mildred
      always declared flatly that he was a genius, that he was too good for
      Sunbury, against the smugness of which community she was inclined to rail.
      A debate on this point between Mrs Henderson and, say, William F. Donovan,
      the drug store man, would have been interesting. Mr Donovan's judgments of
      human character were those of Simpson Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say Henry was strong, because I can't interpret his rugged nonconformity
      in any other way. A weaker lad would long since have given up, gone into
      Smith Brothers' wholesale, taken his spiritual beating and fallen into
      step with his generation. But Henry's resistance was so strong and so deep
      that he didn't even know he was resisting. He was doing the only thing he
      could do, being what he was, feeling what he felt. And when instinct
      failed to guide, when 'the Power' lay quiescent, he was simply waiting and
      blundering along; but never falling into step. He had to wait until the
      Power should rise with him and take him out and up where he belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little scene the Monday evening before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the rooms. Mildred was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stumbled in on the two of them, Mildred and Humphrey. They were at
      the piano, seated side by side. They had been studying <i>Tristan and
      Isolde</i> together for a week or so; Mildred playing out the motifs. She
      often played the love duet from the second act for him, too. Henry heard
      him, mornings, trying to hum it while he shaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      They insisted that he take a chair. He, with a sense of intrusion, took
      the arm of one, and kept hat and stick (his thin bamboo) in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mildred said reflectively:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Corinne writes that she'll be back for a week late in August.' Then,
      noting the touch of dismay on Henry's ingenuous countenance, she added,
      'But you mustn't have her on your conscience, Henry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It isn't that&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm fond of Corinne. But I can see now that you two would never get on
      long together. In a queer way you're too much alike. At least, you both
      have positive qualities. Corinne will some day find a nice little husband
      who'll look after the business side of her concerts. And you&mdash;well,
      Henry, you've got to have some one to mother you.' She smiled at him
      thoughtfully. 'Some one you can make a lot of.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No.' Henry's colour was up. He was shaking his head. 'You don't
      understand. I'm through with girls. They're nothing in my life. Nothing!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shook her head. 'That's absurd, Henry. You're particularly the
      kind. You'll never be able to live without idealising some woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tell you they're nothing to me. My life is different now. I've changed.
      I've put money&mdash;a lot of money&mdash;into the <i>Gleaner</i>. It
      means big responsibilities. You've no idea&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If I hadn't, seen you writing,' she mused aloud.... 'No, Henry. You won't
      change. You'll grow, but you won't change. You're going to write, Henry.
      And you'll always write straight at a woman.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No! No!' Henry was sputtering. He appeared to be struggling. 'Life means
      work to me. I'm through with&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      She took down the <i>Tristan</i> score from the piano and turned the pages
      in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Love is the great vitaliser, Henry,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;it's the mind. Thinking. We have to learn to think clearly&mdash;objectively.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Objectively? No. Not you. And I'm glad, in a way. Because I know we're
      going to be proud of you. But it's love that makes the world go round.
      They don't teach you that in the colleges, but it's the truth... Take
      Wagner&mdash;and <i>Tristan</i>. He wrote it straight at a woman. And it's
      the greatest opera ever written. And the greatest love story. It's that
      because he was terribly in love when he wrote it. Do you Suppose, for one
      minute that if Wagner had never seen Mathilde Wesendonck we should have
      had <i>Tristan?</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused, pursed her lips, studied the book with eyes that seemed to
      grow misty, then looked up at Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He&mdash;tall, angular, very sober&mdash;met her gaze; then his swarthy
      face wrinkled up about the eyes and he hurriedly drew his cob pipe from
      his pocket and began filling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stared at the rug; traced out the pattern with his stick. He
      couldn't answer this last point, because he had never heard of Mathilde
      Wesendonck. And as he was supposed to be 'musical' it seemed best to keep
      quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made an excuse of some sort and went out for a walk. Down by the lake
      he thought of several strong arguments. Mildred was wrong. She had to be
      wrong. For he had cut girls out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like Mildred to speak out in that curiously direct way. She was
      fond of Henry. And she had divined, out of her various, probably rather
      vivid contacts with life, certain half-truths that were not accepted in
      Sunbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think she saw Henry pretty clearly, saw that he was driven by an
      emotional dynamo that was to bring him suffering and success both....
      Mildred, of course, never really belonged in a small town.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the close of the following afternoon that Henry came in and
      found Humphrey's long figure stretched out on the window-seat&mdash;he was
      smoking, of course&mdash;of all things, blowing endless rings up at the
      curtains Mildred had made and hung for him. His dark skin looked gray.
      There were deep lines in his face. He couldn't speak at first. But he
      stared at Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      That young man put away hat and stick, had his coat off, and was rolling
      back his shirt sleeves for a wash, humming the refrain of <i>Kentucky Babe</i>.
      Then, through a slow moment, the queer silence about him, Humphrey's
      attitude&mdash;that fact, for that matter, that Hump was here, at all; he
      was a great hand to work until six or after at the <i>Voice</i> office&mdash;these
      things worked in on him like a premonition. The little song died out. He
      went on, a few steps, toward the bathroom, then came to a stop, turned
      toward the silent figure on the window-seat, came slowly over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he saw his friend clearly. As he sank on the arm of a chair&mdash;it
      was where he had sat the evening before&mdash;he caught his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wha&mdash;what is it?' he asked. His voice was suddenly husky. His mind
      went blank. There was sensation among the roots of his hair. 'What's the
      matter, Hump?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Humphrey took out his pipe and spoke. His voice, too, was low and
      uncertain. But he gathered control of it as he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where've you been?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me? Why, over at Rockwell Park. Bob McGibbon wanted me to see about a
      regular correspondent for the &ldquo;Rockwell Park Doings.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Heard anything?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me? No. Why?... Hump, what is it? What you getting at?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I've got to tell you.' He swung his feet around; sat up; emptied his
      pipe, then filled it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Is it&mdash;is it&mdash;about me, Hump?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. It is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;then&mdash;hadn't you better tell me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm trying to, Hen. It's dam' unpleasant. You remember&mdash;you told me
      once&mdash;early in the summer&mdash;' Humphrey, usually most direct, was
      having difficulty in getting it out&mdash;'you told me you rode a tandem
      up to Hoffmann's Garden with that little Wilcox girl.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, that! That was nothing. Why all the time I lived at Mrs Wilcox's I
      never&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know. Let me try to tell this, Hen. It's hard enough. She's in a
      scrape. That girl. There's a big row on. I'm not going into the details,
      so far as I've heard 'em. There ugly. They wouldn't help. But her mother's
      collapsed. Her uncle and aunt have turned up and taken the girl off
      somewhere. He's a butcher on the North Side.' Henry was pale but
      attentive.
    </p>
    <p>
      'In all the time I lived there,' he began again...
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please, Hen! Wait! It is one of those mean scandals that tear up a town
      like this every now and then. Boils up through the crust and has to be
      noticed. It's a beastly thing. The number of men involved... some older
      ones... and young Bancroft Widdicombe has left town. There's some queer
      talk about her marrying him. And they say one or two others have run away.
      Widdicombe got out before the storm broke. Jim Smith says he's been heard
      from at San Francisco.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But they can't say of me&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen, they can and they do.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I can prove&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What can you prove? What chance will you have to prove anything? You were
      disturbed when Martha Caldwell and the party with Charles H. Merchant
      caught you with her up at Hoffmann's&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Hump, I didn't <i>want</i> to take her out that night! And it's the
      only time I ever really talked to her except once or twice in the
      boarding-house.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was speaking with less energy now. He felt the blow. Not as he would
      feel it a few hours later; but he felt it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It has brought things home to me,' he said uncertainly. 'The sort of
      thing that can happen. When you're caught in a drift, you don't think, of
      course... Now, Hen, listen! This is real trouble. It's going to hit you
      about to-morrow&mdash;full force. It's got to be faced. I don't want to
      think that you'd run&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no,' Henry put in mechanically, 'I won't run.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm sure you won't. But it's got to be faced. You're hit especially.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But why, when I&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because you lived alone there, in the boarding-house, for two years. And
      you were caught with her at Hoffmann's, she in bloomers, drinking beer.
      Just a cheap little tough. And there isn't a thing you can do but live it
      down. Nobody will say a direct word to you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's what I'll do,' said Henry, 'live it down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It'll be hard, Hen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sighed. 'I've faced hard things, Hump.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you have, in a way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll wash up. Where we going to eat? Stanley's?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I suppose. I don't feel like eating much.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until they had started out that Henry gave signs of a deeper
      reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the outer doorstep he stood motionless.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Coming along?' asked Humphrey, trying to hide his anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;yes. In a minute... Say, Hump, do you suppose they'll&mdash;you
      know, I ain't afraid'&mdash;an uprush of feeling coloured his voice,
      brought a shake to it&mdash;'I don't know. Perhaps I <i>am</i> afraid. All
      those people&mdash;you know, at Stanley's...'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey did an unusual thing; laid his hand on Henry's shoulder
      affectionately; then took his arm and led him along the alley, saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'll go down to the lunch counter. It's just as well, Hen. Better get
      sure of yourself first.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered, as they walked rapidly on&mdash;Henry had a tendency to walk
      fast and faster when brooding or excited&mdash;whether the boy would ever
      get sure of himself. There were queer, bitter, profoundly confusing
      thoughts in his own mind, and an emotional tension, but back of all this,
      coming through it and softening him, his feeling for Henry. It was
      something of an elder brother's feeling, I think. Henry seemed very young.
      It was wicked that he had to suffer with all those cynical older men. It
      might mark the boy for life. Such things happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to watch him closely. Sooner or later the thing would hit him
      full. He would have to be protected then. Even from himself, perhaps. In a
      way it oughtn't to be worse for him than it had been after the Hoffmann's
      Garden incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was worse. The other had been, after all, no more than an incident.
      This, now, was an overpowering fact. The town didn't have to notice the
      other. And despite the gossiping instinct, your small community is rather
      glad to edge away from unpleasant surmises that are not established facts.
      Facts are so uncompromising. And so disrupting. And sometimes upsetting to
      standardised thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's it,' thought Humphrey&mdash;he was reduced to thought Henry was
      striding on in white silence&mdash;'it's a fact. They can't evade it. Only
      thing they can do, if they're to keep comfortable about their dam' town,
      is to kill everybody connected with the mess. Have to revise party and
      dinner lists. And it'll raise Ned with the golf tournament. They'll resent
      all that. And they'll have to show outsiders that the thing is an amazing
      exception. Nothing else going on like it. They'll have to show that.'
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning Henry&mdash;stiff, distrait, his eyes wandering a little
      now and then and his sensitive mouth twitching nervously&mdash;breakfasted
      with Humphrey at Stanley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      People&mdash;some people&mdash;spoke to him. But he winced at every
      greeting. Humphrey watched him narrowly. He was ablaze with
      self-consciousness. But he held his head up pretty well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was all shut up within himself. Since their talk of the evening he
      hadn't mentioned the subject. It was clear that he couldn't mention it. He
      spoke of curiously irrelevant things. The style of Robert Louis Stevenson,
      for one. During the walk from the rooms to Stanley's. And then he brought
      up Bob McGibbon's theory that even with a country weekly, if you made your
      paper interesting enough you would get readers and the readers would bring
      the advertising He asked if Humphrey thought it would work out. 'It's
      important to me, you know, Hump. I've got a cool thousand up on the <i>Gleaner</i>.
      It's like betting on Bob McGibbon's idea to win.' His voice trembled a
      little. There were volcanoes of feeling stirring within the boy. He would
      erupt of course, sooner or later. Humphrey found the experience moving to
      the point of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the <i>Gleaner</i> office, Bob McGibbon, looking up at him
      anxiously, said good-morning, then pursed his lips in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found occasion to say, later:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry, how are you taking this thing?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry swallowed, glanced out of the window, then threw out one hand with
      an expressive gesture and raised his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh,' he said, 'all right. I&mdash;it's not true, Bob. Not about me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's just what I tell 'em,' said McGibbon eagerly. 'What you going to
      do? Go right on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;why, yes! I can't run away.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course not. These things are mean. In a small town. Hypocrisy all
      round. I was thinking it over this morning, and it occurred to me you
      might like to get off by yourself and do some real writing for the paper.
      That's what we need, you know. Sketches. Snappy poetry. Little pictures of
      life-like George Ade's stuff in the <i>Record</i>. Or a bit of the 'Gene
      Field touch. Something they'd have to read. Make the <i>Gleaner</i> known.
      Put it on every centre table in Sunbury. That's what we really need from
      you, you know. Your own stuff, not ours. Take this reception to-night at
      the Jenkins'. Anybody can cover that. I'll go myself.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, pale, lips compressed, shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said he, after a pause, 'I'll cover it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon considered this, then moved irresolutely back to his desk. Here,
      for a time, he sat, with knit brows, and stabbed at flies with his pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be walking into the lion's den, that was all. He wished he could
      think of a way to hold the boy back. There were complications. The <i>Gleaner</i>,
      just, lately, had been going pretty violently after what McGibbon called
      the 'Old Cinch.' Without quite enough evidence, they were now virtually
      accusing Waterhouse of embezzlement, and the others of connivance. Mr
      Weston was among the most respected in Sunbury, rich, solid, a supporter
      of all good things'. Though Boice and Waterhouse were unknown to local
      society, the Westons were intimate with the Jenkinses and their crowd.
      They all regarded the <i>Gleaner</i> as a scurrilous, libellous sheet, and
      McGibbon himself as an intruder in the village life. And there was another
      trouble; very recent. He couldn't speak of it with the boy in this state
      of mind. Not at the moment. He couldn't see his way... And now, with the
      realest-scandal Sunbury had known in a decade piled freshly on the paper's
      bad name. But he couldn't think of a way to keep him from going. The boy
      was, in a way, his partner. There were little delicacies between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reception given by Mr and Mrs Jenkins to Senator and Madame William M.
      Watt, was the most important social event of the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jenkins's home, a square mansion of yellow brick, blazed with light at
      every window. Japanese lanterns were festooned from tree to tree about the
      lawn. An awning had been erected all the way from the front steps to the
      horse block, and a man in livery stood out there assisting the ladies from
      their carriages. It was felt by some, it was even remarked in undertones,
      that the Jenkinses were spreading it on pretty thick, even considering
      that it was the first really public appearance of the Watts in Sunbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator was known principally as titular sponsor for the Watt Currency
      Act, of fifteen years back... In those days his fame had overspread the
      boundaries of his own eastern state clear to California and the Mexican
      border. Older readers will recall that the Watt Bill nearly split a nation
      in its day. After his defeat for re-election, in the earlier nineties, he
      had slipped quietly into the obscurity in which he regained until his
      rather surprising marriage with the very rich, extremely vigorous American
      woman from abroad who called herself the Comtesse de la Plaine. At the
      time of his disappearance from public life various reasons had been dwelt
      on. One was drink. His complexion&mdash;the part of it not covered by his
      white beard&mdash;might have been regarded as corroborative evidence. But
      it was generally understood that he was 'all right' now; a meek enough
      little man, well past seventy, with an air of life-weariness and a
      suppressed cough that was rather disagreeable in church. His slightly
      unkempt beard grew a little to one side, giving his face a twisted
      appearance. On his occasional appearances about the streets he was always
      chewing an unlighted cigar. To the growing generation he was a mildly
      historic myth, like Thomas Buchanan or James G. Blaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs Watt&mdash;who during her brief residence in Sunbury (they had bought
      the Dexter Smith place, on Hazel Avenue, in May) had somehow attached
      firmly to her present name the foreign-sounding prefix, 'Madame'&mdash;was
      a head taller than her husband, with snappy black eyes, a strongly hooked
      nose and an indomitable mouth. She was not beautiful, but was of
      commanding presence. The fact that she had lived long in France naturally
      raised questions. But there appeared to be no questioning either her
      earlier title or her wealth. If she seemed to lack a few of the
      refinements of a lady&mdash;it was whispered among the younger people that
      she swore at her servants&mdash;still, a rich countess, married to the
      self-effacing but indubitable author of the Watt Act, was, in the nature
      of things, equipped to stir Sunbury to the depths.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the member of this interesting family with whom we are now concerned
      was the Madame's niece, a girl of eighteen or nineteen who had been
      reared, it was said, in a convent in France, then educated at a school in
      the eastern states, and was now living with her aunt for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her name fell oddly on ears accustomed to the Bessies, Marys, Fannies,
      Marthas, Louises, Alices, and Graces of Sunbury. It was Cicely&mdash;Cicely
      Hamlin. It was clearly an English name. It proved, at first, difficult to
      pronounce, and led to joking among the younger set. The girl herself was
      rather foreign in appearance. Distinctly French some said. She was slimly
      pretty, with darkish hair and a quick, brisk, almost eager way of speaking
      and smiling and bobbing her hair. She used her hands, too, more than was
      common in Sunbury, a point for the adherents of the French theory. The
      quality that perhaps most attracted young and old alike was her sensitive
      responsiveness. Sometimes it was nearly timidity. She would listen in her
      eager way; then talk, all vivacity&mdash;head and hands moving, on the
      brink of a smile-every moment&mdash;then seem suddenly to recede a little,
      as if fearful that she had perhaps said too much, as if a delicate
      courtesy demanded that she be merely the attentive, kindly listener. She
      could play and be merry with the younger crowd. But she had read books
      that few of them had ever heard of. Plainly&mdash;though nothing so
      complex was plain to Henry at this period&mdash;she was a girl of delicate
      nervous organisation, strung a little tightly; a girl who could be stirred
      to almost naïve enthusiasms and who could perhaps be cruelly hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had seen her&mdash;once on the hotel veranda talking brightly with
      Mary Ames, who seemed almost stodgy beside her, once on the Chicago train,
      once or twice driving with Elberforce Jenkins in his high cart. The sight
      of her had stirred him. Already he had had to fight thoughts of her&mdash;tantalisingly
      indistinct mental visions&mdash;during the late night hours between
      staring wakefulness and sleep. And it was impossible wholly to escape
      bitterness over the thought that he hadn't met her. He oughtn't to care.
      He couldn't admit to himself that it mattered. A couple of years back, in
      his big days, they would have met all right. First thing. Everybody would
      have seen to it. They would have told her about him. Now... oh well!
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the shadow, out by the carriage entrance, pulling at his
      moustache. There had been a sort of rushing of the spirit, almost a
      fervour, in his first determination to face the town bravely. Now for the
      first time he began to see that the thing couldn't be rushed at. It might
      take years to build up a new good name&mdash;years of slights and sneers,
      of dull hours and slack nerves. For Henry did know that emotional climaxes
      pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chose a time, between carriages, when the sheltered walk was empty, to
      move up toward the house. Everybody here was dressed up&mdash;'Wearing
      everything they've got!' he muttered. He himself had on his blue suit and
      straw hat and carried his bamboo stick. A thick wad of copy paper
      protruded from a side pocket. A vest pocket bulged with newly sharpened
      pencils. It had seemed best not to dress. He wasn't a guest; just the
      representative of a country weekly.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the front steps there were arched openings in the canvas. Up there in
      the light were music and rustling, continuous movement and the unearthly
      cackling sound that you hear when you listen with a detached mind to many
      chattering voices in an enclosed space. Mrs Jenkins was up there,
      doubtless, at the head of a reception line. He knew now, with despair in
      his heart, that he couldn't mount those steps. Nearly everybody there
      would know him. He couldn't do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked around. At one side stood a jolly little group, under the
      Japanese lanterns. Young people. Two detached themselves and came toward
      the steps. A third joined them; a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here,' said this girl&mdash;Mary Ames's voice&mdash;'you two wait here.
      I'll find her.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary came right past him and ran up the steps. Henry drew back, very
      white, curiously breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two stood close at hand. Henry wondered if he could slip away.
      New carriages had arrived; new people were coming up the walk. He stepped
      off on the grass. He found difficulty in thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, just across the walk, was Cicely Hamlin. The fellow was Alfred
      Knight. He worked in the bank; a colourless youth. He plainly didn't know
      what to say to this very charming new girl. He stood there, shifting his
      feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry thought: 'Has he heard yet? Does he know?... Does <i>she</i> know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Alfred's wandering eye rested on him, hailed him with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, hallo. Hen;' he said. Then, after a long silence, 'Like you to meet
      Miss Hamlin. Mr Henry Calverly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Al Knight never could remember whether you said the girl's name first or
      the man's.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he hadn't heard yet. Evidently. Henry sighed. Since it had to come, it
      would be almost better...
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Cicely Hamlin moved a hesitant step forward; murmured his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to step forward too.
    </p>
    <p>
      In sheer miserable embarrassment he raised his hand a little way.
    </p>
    <p>
      In responsive confusion she raised hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his had dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hers moved downward as his came up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at this and extended her hand again frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took it. He didn't know that he was gripping it in a strong nervous
      clasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've heard of you,' she said. He liked her voice. 'You write, don't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes,' said he huskily, 'I write some.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered dully who could have told her of him. It sounded like the old
      days. It was almost, for a moment, encouraging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Al Knight drifted away to speak to one of the new-comers.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you write stories?' she asked politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I try to, sometimes. It's awfully hard.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh yes, I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do <i>you</i> write?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;oh no! But I've wished I could. I've tried a little.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as words went they might as well have been mentioning the weather.
      It was not an occasion in which words had any real part. He saw, felt, the
      presence of a girl unlike any he had known&mdash;slimly pretty, alive with
      a quick eager interest, and subtly friendly. She saw, and felt, a white
      tragic face out of which peered eyes with a gloomy fire in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Alfred Knight drifted back she asked him to call. Then, at the
      sight of them, Alfred drifted away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps,' she added shyly, 'you'd bring some of your stories.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I haven't anything I could bring,' he replied, still with that burning
      look. 'Nothing 'that's any good. If I had...' Then this blazed from him in
      a low shaky voice: 'You haven't heard what they're saying about me. I can
      see that. If you had you wouldn't ask me to call.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I'm sure I would,' she murmured, greatly confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You wouldn't. You really couldn't. But I want to say this&mdash;quick,
      before they come!'&mdash;for he saw Mary Ames in the doorway&mdash;'I've
      <i>got</i> to say it! They'll tell you something about me. Something
      dreadful. It isn't true. It&mdash;is&mdash;not true!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She isn't in there,' said Mary, joining them. Then 'Oh!' She looked at
      Henry with a hint of alarm in her face; said, 'How do you do!' in a voice
      that chilled him, brought the despair back; then said to Cicely, ignoring
      him: 'We'd better tell them.' And moved a step toward the group under the
      lanterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was happening, right there; and in the cruellest manner. Henry couldn't
      speak. He felt as if a fire were burning in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Al Knight, seeing Mary, drifted back.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group, over yonder, was breaking up. Or coming this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another moment and Elberforce Jenkins&mdash;tall, really good-looking in
      his perfect-fitting evening clothes&mdash;stood before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at Henry. Gave him the cut direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right,' said Elbow Jenkins, addressing Cicely now, 'we'll go without
      her. She won't mind.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Cicely hesitated. For a moment, standing there, lips parted a
      little, looking from one to another. Then, with an air of shyness,
      apparently still confused, she gave Henry her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do come,' she said, with a quick little smile. 'And bring the stories.
      I'm sure I'd like them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She went with them, then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stared after her with wet eyes. Then for a while he wandered alone
      among the trees. His thoughts, like his pulse, were racing uncontrollably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be noted that he returned a while later, faced Mrs Jenkins, wrote
      down the names of all the guests he recognised, and walked, very fast,
      with a stiff dignity, lips compressed, eyes and brain still burning, down
      to the <i>Gleaner</i> office.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      The story had to be written. Not at the rooms, though; Mildred might be
      there with Humphrey. Sometimes he worked at the Y.M.C.A.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a light in the windows of the <i>Gleaner</i> office, over
      Hemple's.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon was up there, bent over his desk in his shirtsleeves, a hand
      sprawling through his straight ragged hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry acknowledged his partner's greeting with a grunt; dropped down at
      his own desk; plunged at the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon looked up once or twice, saw that Henry was unaware of him;
      continued his own work. His thin face looked worn. He bit his lip a good
      deal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There,' said Henry, finally, with a grim look&mdash;'there's the
      reception story.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, all right.' McGibbon came over; took the pencilled script; then sat
      on the edge of the table beside Henry's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Haven't got some good filler stuff?' he queried wearily, brushing a hand
      across his forehead. 'We're going to have a lot of extra space this week.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched Henry, to see if this remark had an effect. It had none. He
      nibbed his hand slowly back and forth across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The fact is,' he remarked, 'they've landed on us. Pretty hard. The
      advertisers. Just about all Simpson Street. It's a sort of boycott,
      apparently. Takes out two-thirds of our advertising. And Weston called my
      note&mdash;that two hundred and forty-eight&mdash;for paper. Simply
      charged it up against our account. Pretty dam' high-handed, I call it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was rising. He sprang up, paced the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They're showing fight,' he ran on. 'We've got to lick 'em. That's my way&mdash;start
      at the drop of the hat. What's a little advertising! Get readers&mdash;that's
      the real trick of it. We'll lick 'em with circulation, that's what we'll
      do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood over Henry's desk; even pounded it. The boy didn't seem to get
      it, even now. He was hardly listening. With his own money at stake. But
      McGibbon was finding him like that; queer gaps on the practical side. No
      money sense whatever!
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry,' he was crying now, 'it's up to you. You're a genius. It's sheer
      waste to use you on fool receptions. <i>Write</i>, man! WRITE! Let
      yourself go. Anything&mdash;sketches, verse, stories! Let's give 'em what
      they don't look for in a country paper. Like the old Burlington <i>Hawkeye</i>
      and that fellow Brann. And the paper in Lahore that nobody would ever have
      heard of if Kipling hadn't written prose and verse to fill in, here and
      there. He was a kid, too. There's always, somewhere, a little paper that's
      famous because a man can <i>write</i>. Why shouldn't it be us! Us! Right
      up here over the meat-market. Why, we can make the little old <i>Gleaner</i>
      known from coast to coast. We can put Sunbury on the map. Just with your
      pen, my boy! With your pen! And then where'll old Weston be! Where'll
      these little two-bit advertisers be!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He spread his thin hands in a gesture of triumph. Henry looked up now;
      slowly pushed back his chair; said, in a weak voice, 'I'm tired. Guess I'd
      better get along;' and walked out.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon stared after him, his mouth literally open.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      Back of the old Parmenter place the barn was dark. Henry felt relief. He
      was tingling with excitement. He couldn't move slowly. His fists were
      clenched. Every nerve in his body was strung tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking hopelessly, 'I must relax.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He crept through the dim shop, among Humphrey's lathes, belts, benches of
      tools, big kites and rows of steel wheels mounted in frames. There were
      large planes, too, parts of the gliders Humphrey had been puttering with
      for a long time. Three years, he had once said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry lingered on the stairs and looked about the ghostly rooms. Beams of
      moonlight came in through the windows and touched this and that machine.
      He felt himself attuned to all the trouble, the disaster, in the universe.
      Life was a tragic disappointment. Nothing ever came right. People didn't
      succeed; they struggled and struggled to breast a mighty, tireless current
      that swept them ever backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor old Hump! He had put money into this shop. All the little he had; or
      nearly all. And into the technical library that lined his bedroom walls
      upstairs. His daily work at the <i>Voice</i> office was just a grind, to
      keep body and soul together while the experiments were working out. Hump
      was patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Until I moved in here,' Henry thought, with a disturbingly passive sort
      of' bitterness, 'and brought girls and things. He doesn't have his nights
      and Sundays for work any more. Hump could do big things, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on up the stairs and switched on the lights in the living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught sight of his face in a mirror. It was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a look of strain about the eyes. The little moustache, turned up
      at the ends, mocked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll shave it off,' he said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      He even got out his razor and began nervously stropping it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alarmed to discover that his control of his hands was none too
      good. They moved more quickly than he meant them to, and in jerks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too, the notion of shaving his moustache struck him weakness, an impulse
      to be resisted. Too much like retreating. Subtly like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the razor back in its drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the centre of the living-room rug, standing there, stiffly, he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll face them. I'll go down fighting. They shan't say I surrendered.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked round and round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never in his life felt anything like this jerky nervousness. A
      restlessness that wouldn't permit him so much as to sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in the <i>Gleaner</i> office he had hardly been aware of McGibbon.
      He certainly hadn't listened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now, like a blow, everything McGibbon had said came to him. Every
      syllable. Suddenly he could see the man, towering ever him, pounding his
      desk. Talking&mdash;talking&mdash;full of fresh hopes while the world
      crumbled around him. More disaster! It was the buzzing song of the old
      globe as it spun endlessly on its axis. Disaster!... The advertisers had
      at last combined against the paper. Old Weston had called McGibbon's note.
      That must have taken about the last of Henry's thousand. They were broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hand brushed his coat pocket. It bulged with copy paper. He must have
      thrust it back there absently, at the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew it out and gazed at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious; he seemed to see it as a printed page, with a title at the
      top, and his name. He couldn't see what the title was. Yet it was there,
      and it was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      His restlessness grew. Again he walked round and round the room. There was
      a glow in his breast. Something that burned and fired his nerves and drove
      him as one is driven in a dream. Either he must rush outdoors and wander
      at a feverish pace around the town and up the lake shore&mdash;walk all
      night&mdash;or he must sit down and write.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down. Picked up an atlas of Humphrey's and wrote on his lap. And he
      wrote, from the beginning, as he would have walked had he gone out, in a
      fever of energy, gripping the pencil tightly, holding his knees up a
      little, heels off the floor. The colour reappeared about his forehead and
      temples, then on his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Humphrey came in, after midnight, he was in just this posture,
      writing at a desperate rate. The floor all about him was strewn with
      sheets of paper. One or two had drifted off to the centre of the room. He
      didn't hear his friend come up the stairs.' When he saw him, standing,
      looking down, something puzzled, he cried out excitedly':&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't Hump!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey resisted the impulse to reply with a 'Don't what?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go on! Don't disturb me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You seem to be hitting it up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am. I can't talk! Please&mdash;go away! Go to bed. You'll make me lose
      it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later&mdash;well along in the night&mdash;he awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a crack of light about his door. He turned on his own light. It
      was quarter to three.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here!' he called. 'What on earth are you up to, Hen?' A chair scraped.
      Then Henry came to the door and burst it open. His coat was off now, and
      his vest open. He had unbuttoned his collar in front so that the two ends
      and the ends of his tie hung down. His hair was straggling down over his
      forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know what time it is, Hen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Say&mdash;listen to this! Just a few sentences. You liked the piece I
      did about the Business Men's Picnic, remember. Well, this has sorta grown
      out of it. It's just the plain folks along Simpson Street. Say! There's a
      title for the book.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For the what!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The book. Oh, there'll be a lot of them. Sorta sketches. Or maybe they're
      stories. I can't tell yet. Plain folks of Simpson Street. Yes, that's
      good. Wait a second, while I write it down. The thing struck me all at
      once&mdash;to-night!&mdash;Queer, isn't it!&mdash;thinking about the folks
      along the street&mdash;Bill Hemple, and Jim Smith in your press room with
      the tattooed arms, and old Boice and Charlie Waterhouse, and the way Bob
      McGibbon blew into town with a big dream, and the barber shop&mdash;Schultz
      and Schwartz's&mdash;and Donovan's soda fountain, and Izzy Bloom and the
      trouble about his boys in the high school, and all his fires, and Mr
      Draine, the Y.M.C.A. secretary that's been in the British Mounted Police
      in Mashonaland&mdash;think of it! In Africa&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Would you mind'&mdash;Humphrey was on an elbow, blinking sleepy eyes&mdash;'would
      you mind talking a little more slowly. Good lord! I can't&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right, Hump. Only I'm excited, sorta. You see, it just struck me that
      there's as much romance right here on Simpson Street as there is in
      Kipling's Hills or Bagdad or Paris. Just the way people's lives go. And
      what old Berger's really thinking about when he tells you the vegetables
      were picked yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey gazed&mdash;wider awake now&mdash;at the wild figure before him.
      And a thrill stirred his heart. This boy was supposed to be crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How much have you done?' he asked soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most finished this first one. It's about old Boice and Charlie Waterhouse
      and Mr Weston&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gee!' said Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I call it, <i>The Caliph of Simpson Street</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;see here, you're going to bed, aren't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes. But listen.' And he began reading aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey waved his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, no! For heaven's sake, go to bed, Hen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, but&mdash;oh, say! Just thought of something!' And he went out,
      chuckling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey awoke again at eight. Through his open door came a light that was
      not altogether of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident of the earlier morning came to him in confused form, like a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, still bending over the atlas, was Henry. The sheets of paper lay
      like drifts of snow about him now. His pencil was flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up. His face was white and red in spots now. He was grinning,
      apparently out of sheer happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say,' he cried, 'listen to this! It's one I call, <i>The Cauliflowers of
      the Caliph</i>. Oh, by the way, I've changed the title of the book to <i>Satraps
      of the Simple</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The whole book'll be sort of imaginary, like that. It's queer. Just as if
      it came to be out of the air. Things I never thought of in my life. Only
      everything I ever knew's going into it. Things I'd forgotten.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen,' said Humphrey, 'are you stark mad?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me? Why&mdash;why no, Hump!' The grin was a thought sheepish now. 'But&mdash;well,
      Bob McGibbon said we needed stuff for the paper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many stories have you written already?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just three.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>Three!</i> In one night!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But they're short, Hump. I don't believe-they average over two or three
      thousand words. I think they're good. You know, just the way they made me
      feel. Funny idea&mdash;Bagdad and Simpson Street, all mixed up together.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One thing's certain, Hen. You're an extremely surprising youth, but right
      here's where you quit. I don't propose to have a roaring maniac here in
      the rooms. On my hands.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Hump, I can't quit now! You don't understand. It's wonderful. It just
      comes. Like taking dictation.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Dictation is what you're going to take. Right now. From me. Brush up your
      clothes, and pick up all that mess while I dress. We'll go out for some
      breakfast.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not now, Hump! Wait&mdash;I promise I'll go out a little later.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'll go now. Get up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry obeyed. But he nearly fell back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gosh!' he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stiff, eh?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I should smile. And sorta weak.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No wonder. Come on, now! And I want your promise that after breakfast
      you'll go straight to bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump, I can't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This, apparently, was the truth. He couldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in at Jackson's Book Store (formerly B. F. Jones's) and bought
      paper and pencils: Then, in a thrill of fresh importance, he bought
      penholders, large desk blotters, a flannel pen-wiper with a bronze dog
      seated in the centre, a cut-glass inkstand, a ruler, half a dozen pads of
      a better paper, a partly abridged dictionary, Roget's <i>Thesaurus</i>,
      (for years he had casually wondered what a Thesaurus was), a round glass
      paperweight with a gay butterfly imprisoned within, four boxes of wire
      clips, assorted sizes, and, because he saw it, Crabb's <i>Synonyms</i>.
      Then he saw an old copy of <i>The Thousand and One Nights</i> and bought
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to him that he ought to be equipped for his work. Before he went
      out he asked the prices of the better makes of typewriters.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for the first time in two years, he uttered the magic but too often
      fatal words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just charge it, if you don't mind.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      7
    </h3>
    <p>
      He was back at the rooms by nine-fifteen. Before the university clock
      boomed out the hour of noon, he had written that elusive, extraordinary
      little classic, <i>A Kerbstone Barmecide</i>, and had jotted down
      suggestive notes for the story that was later to be known as <i>The
      Printer and the Pearls</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time all thoughts of civic reform had faded out. Charlie
      Waterhouse, now that <i>The Caliph of Simpson Street</i> was done and, in
      a surface sense, forgotten, no longer appeared to him as a crook who
      should be ousted from the local political triumvirate and from town
      office; he was but a bit of ore in the rich lode of human material with
      which Henry's fancy was playing. The important fact about the new
      Waterhouse store-and-office building in South Sunbury, was not that there
      was reason to believe Charlie had built it with town money but that he had
      put a medallion bas-relief of himself in terra cotta in the front wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie figured, though, unquestionably, in <i>Sinbad the Treasurer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, deciding that he would stroll out after a little and eat a bite,
      Henry stretched out on the lounge. Here he dozed, very lightly for an hour
      or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey stole in, found him tossing there, fully dressed, mumbling in his
      sleep, and stole out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But early in the afternoon Henry leaped up. His brain, or his emotions, or
      whatever the source of his ideas, was a glowing, boiling, seething crater
      of tantalising, obscurely associated concepts and scraps of
      characterisation and queerly vivid, half-glimpsed dramatic moments,
      situations, contrasts. They amounted to a force that dragged him on. The
      thought that some bit might escape before he could catch it and get it
      written down kept his pulse racing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about half-past four he finished that curious fantasy, <i>Roc's Eggs,
      Strictly Fresh</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This accomplishment brought a respite. He could see his book clearly now.
      The cover, the title page and particularly the final sentence. He knew
      that the concluding story was to be called <i>The Old Man of the Street</i>.
      He printed out this title; printed, too, several titles of others yet to
      be written&mdash;<i>Ali Anderson and the Four Policemen</i> and <i>Scheherazade
      in a Livery Stable</i>, and one or two more.
    </p>
    <p>
      His next performance I find particularly interesting in retrospect. During
      the long two years of his extreme self-suppression in the vital matters of
      candy, girls, and charge-accounts, Henry had firmly refused to sing.
      Without a murmur he had foregone the four or five dollars a Sunday he
      could easily have picked up in church quartet work, the occasional sums
      from substituting in this or that male quartet and singing at funerals. It
      was even more extraordinary that he should have given up, as he did, his
      old habit of singing to girls. The only explanation he had ever offered of
      this curious stand was the rather obscure one he gave Humphrey that
      singing was 'too physical.' Whatever the real complex of motives, it had
      been a rather violent, or at least a complete reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he strode about the room, chin up, chest expanded, brows puckered,
      roaring out scales and other vocalisings in his best voice. The results
      naturally were somewhat disappointing, after the long silence, but he kept
      at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still roaring, half an hour later, when McGibbon came anxiously in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Saw Humphrey Weaver down-town,' said the editor of the <i>Gleaner</i>,
      'and he said I'd better look you up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later McGibbon&mdash;red spots in his cheeks, a nervous glitter in
      his eyes&mdash;hurried down to the <i>Gleaner</i> office with the
      pencilled manuscripts of four of the 'Caliph' stories. He was hurrying
      because it seemed to him highly important to get them into type. For one
      thing, something might happen to them&mdash;fire, anything. For another,
      it might occur to Henry to sell them to an eastern magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Humphrey came in, just before six, Henry was already well into <i>Scheherazade
      in a Livery Stable</i>, and was chuckling out loud as he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friday night was press night at the <i>Gleaner</i> office. Henry strolled
      in about ten o'clock and carelessly dropped a thick roll of script on
      McGibbon's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      That jaded editor leaned back, ran thin fingers through his tousled hair,
      and wearily looked over the dishevelled, yawning, exhausted, grinning
      youth before him. Never in his life had he seen an expression of such
      utter happiness on a human face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many stories is this?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ten.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good Lord! That's a whole book!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;hardly. I've thought of some more. There'll be fifteen or twenty
      altogether. I just thought of one, coming over here. Think I'll call it.
      <i>The Story of the Man from Jerusalem</i>. It's about the life of a
      little Jew storekeeper in a town like this. Struck me all of a sudden&mdash;you
      know, how he must feel. I don't think I'll write it to-night&mdash;just
      make a few notes so it won't get away from me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob McGibbon rose up, put on coat and hat, took, Henry firmly by the arm,
      and marched him, protesting, home.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now,' he said, 'you go to bed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure, Bob! What's the matter with you! I'm just going to jot down a few
      notes&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're going to bed!' said McGibbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he stood there, earnest, even grim, until Henry was undressed and
      stretched out peacefully asleep.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry slept until nearly three o'clock Saturday afternoon.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Senator Watt laid down the <i>Gleaner</i>, took off his glasses, removed
      an unlighted cigar from his mouth, and said, in his low, slightly husky
      voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'A really remarkable piece of work. Quite worthy of Kipling.' The
      nineties, as we have already remarked, belong to Kipling. Outright. He had
      to be mentioned. 'It is fresh, vivid, and remarkably condensed. The author
      produces his effects with a sure swift stroke of the brush.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator rarely spoke. When he did it was always in these measured,
      solid sentences, as if his words might be heard round the world and
      therefore must be chosen with infinite care. After delivering himself of
      this opinion he resumed his 'dry smoke' and reached for the <i>Evening
      Post</i>, which lay folded back to the financial page.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was sure you would think so,' said Cicely Hamlin, glancing first at the
      Senator then at her aunt. 'I wish you would read it, Aunt Eleanor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm!' remarked that formidable person, planting her own gold-rimmed
      glasses firmly astride her rugged nose just above the point where it bent
      sharply downward, picking up the paper, then lowering it to gaze with a
      hint of habitual, impersonal severity at her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Even so,' she said. 'Suppose the young man has gifts. That will hardly
      make it necessary for you to cultivate him. I gather he's a bad lot.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have no intention of cultivating him,' replied Cicely, moving toward
      the door, but pausing by the mantel to pat her dark ample hair into place.
      She wore it low on her shapely neck. Cicely was wearing a
      simple-appearing, far from inexpensive blue frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Watt read the opening sentence of <i>The Caliph of Simpson Street</i>,
      then lowered the paper again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you going out, Cicely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I expect company here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who is coming?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl compressed her lips for an instant, then:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Elberforce Jenkins.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm!' said Madame, and raised the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      An electric bell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely came back into the room; stood by a large bowl of roses; considered
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler passed through the wide hall. A voice sounded in the distance.
      The butler appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr Henry Calverly calling,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Watt raised her head so abruptly that her glasses fell, brought up
      with a jerk at the end of a thin gold chain, and swung there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely stood motionless by the roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator glanced up, then shifted his cigar and resumed his study of
      the financial page.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will hardly&mdash;&mdash;' began Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Show him into the drawing-room,' said Cicely with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as if to settle all such small difficulties, Henry himself appeared
      behind him, smiling naively, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely hurried forward. Her quick smile came, and the little bob of her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you do?' she said brightly. 'Mr Calverly&mdash;my aunt, Madame
      Watt! And my uncle, Senator Watt!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Watt arose, deliberately, not without a solid sort of majesty. She
      was a presence; no other such ever appeared in Sunbury. She fixed an
      uncompromising gaze on Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      So uncompromising was it that Cicely covered her embarrassment by moving
      hurriedly toward the drawingroom, with a quick:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come right in here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one living on this erratic earth who could have cowed Henry
      on this Saturday evening. A week later, yes. But not to-night. He never
      even suspected that Madame meant to cow him. In such moments as these (and
      there were a good many of them in his life) Henry was incapable of
      perceiving hostility toward himself. The disaster that on Tuesday had
      seemed the end of the world was to-night a hazy memory of another epoch.
      There were few grown or half-grown persons in Sunbury that were not
      thinking on this evening of the meanest scandal in the known history of
      the town and, incidentally, among others involved, of Henry Calverly; but
      Henry himself was of those few.
    </p>
    <p>
      He marched straight on Madame with cordial smile and outstretched hand. He
      wrung the hand of the impassive Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      That worthy said, now:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I have just read this first of your new series of sketches. Allow me to
      tell you that I think it admirable. In the briefest possible compass you
      have pictured a whole community in its petty relationships, at once tragic
      and comic. There is caustic satire in this sketch, yet I find deep human
      sympathy as well. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance.'
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after a rather amazing outpouring of words&mdash;the thing didn't
      amount to much; just a rough draft really; he hoped they'd like the next
      one; it was about cauliflowers&mdash;he had disappeared into the front
      room, the Senator remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The young man makes an excellent impression.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'The young man,' remarked Madame, 'is all right.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later the noise of the front door opening, and a voice,
      caused the two young people to start up out of a breathless absorption in
      the story called <i>A Kerbstone Barmecide</i>, which Henry was reading
      from long strips of galley proof. He had already finished <i>The
      Cauliflowers of the Caliph</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Cicely's face went blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butler announced:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mr Jenkins calling, Miss Cicely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The one who was not equal to the situation was Elbow. He stood in the
      doorway, staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely was only a moment late with her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, with an open sigh of regret, nodded at his old acquaintance and
      folded up the long strips of galley proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elbow came into the room now, and took Cicely's hand. But his small talk
      had gone with his wits. He barely returned Henry's nod. Cicely, nervously
      active, suggested a chair, asked if there was going to be a Country Club
      dance this week, thanked him for the beautiful roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then silence fell upon them; an awkward silence, that seemed to announce
      when it set in its intention of making itself increasingly awkward and
      very, very long. It was confirmed as a hopeless silence by the sudden
      little catchings of breath, the slight leaning forward, followed by
      nothing at all&mdash;first on the part of Cicely, then of Elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sat still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he raised his eyes. They met squarely the eyes of Elbow. For a long
      moment each held the gaze. It was war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely said now, greatly confused:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know that you sing, Mr Calverly. Please do sing something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There, now, was an idea! It appealed warmly to Henry. He went straight to
      the piano, twisted up the stool, struck his three chords in turn, and
      plunged into that old song of Samuel's Lover's that has quaint charm when
      delivered with spirit and humour, <i>Kitty of Coleraine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which he sang, <i>Rory O'More</i>. He had spirit and humour aplenty
      to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator came quietly in, bowed to Elbow, and asked for <i>The Low-Back
      Car</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elbow left.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why did you tell me you hadn't any stories you could bring?' Cicely
      asked, a touch of indignation in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was so. I didn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had these.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I didn't. That's just it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you don't mean&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes! Just since I met you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ten stories, you said. It seems&mdash;I can't&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it's true. Three days. And nights, of course. I've been so excited!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I never heard of such a thing! Though, of course, Stevenson wrote <i>Dr
      Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i> in three days. But ten different stories.'... She
      sat quiet, her hands folded in her lap, very thoughtful, flatteringly
      thoughtful. 'It sounds a little like magic.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was delicately pretty, sitting so still in her big chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wrote them straight at you,' he said, low, earnest. 'Every word.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Henry caught the extreme emphasis of this, and hurried to elaborate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You see I was just sick Tuesday night. Everything had gone wrong with me.
      And then that horrible story that wasn't true. I knew I shouldn't have
      spoken of it to you, but&mdash;well, it was just driving me crazy, and I
      couldn't bear to think you might despise me like the others without ever
      knowing the truth. And... You see I must have felt the inspiration you...
      Even then, I mean...'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was red. He seemed to be getting himself out of breath. And he was
      tugging at the roll of proofs in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shall I&mdash;finish&mdash;this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, <i>yes!</i>' She sank into a great leather chair; looked up at him
      with glowing eyes. 'I want you to read me all of them. Please!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She said it almost shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry drew up a chair, found his place, and read on. And on. And on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was victory.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>here is nothing
      more unsettling than a sudden uncalculated, incalculable success. It at
      once thrills, depresses, confuses. People attack with the most unexpected
      venom. Others, the most unexpected others, defend with vehemence, One
      feels queerly out of it, yet forlornly conspicuous. As if it were some one
      else, or a dream. Innocent effort dragged to the public arena, quarrelled
      over, misunderstood. One boasts and apologises in a breath; dreads the
      thing will keep up and fears it will stop; finds one day it has stopped

      the great days, when one did stir them up a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry awoke on this Saturday morning to a sense of trouble that hung
      heavily over him during the walk with Humphrey from the rooms to
      Stanley's. Nothing of the stir reached them here. They were so late that
      the restaurant was about empty. Humphrey did hear a faint, distant voice
      booming, but gave no particular thought to it at the moment. And the
      Stanleys went quietly about their business as usual. Henry, indeed, was
      deep in his personal concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      This found words over the oatmeal. He drew a rumpled paper from his pocket
      and submitted it to his room mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Got this last night,' Henry explained moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey read the following pencilled communication:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry Calverly, can't you see that your attentions are making it hard for
      a certain young lady? Do you want to injure her reputation along with
      yours? Why don't you do the decent thing and leave town!
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>A Round Robin of People Who Know You</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey pursed his lips over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's the Mamie Wilcox trouble, of course,' he said finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded. His mouth drooped at the corners. There was a shine in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey folded the paper; handed it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you know who did it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry shook his head. 'They printed it out. Oh, I can make guesses, of
      course. It's about Cicely Hamlin and me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You can't do anything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And maybe you're going to be so successful that it won't matter. Laugh at
      'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't believe that, Hump. I can't even imagine it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'At that, it may be jealousy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've thought of that. Even if it is...' they're partly right. I didn't do
      what they think, but... Don't you see, Hump?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes, I see clearly enough.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've felt it. When I was all stirred up over my work, I went there to
      call. Last Saturday night. Then I got to thinking.' His voice was
      unsteady, but he kept on. Rather doggedly. 'I've stayed away all this
      week. Just worked. You know. You've seen how I've kept at it. Until
      Thursday night. I sorta slipped up then and went around there. She was
      out. And that's all. I've thought I&mdash;I've felt... Hump, do you
      believe in love&mdash;you know&mdash;at first sight?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's long face wrinkled into a rather wry smile, then sobered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I ought to,' he replied. 'In a way it was like that&mdash;with me.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first of Henry's meaty, fantastic little stories of the plain folk of
      the village, that one called <i>The Caliph of Simpson Street</i>, had
      appeared in the <i>Gleaner</i> of the preceding Saturday. It had made a
      distinct stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second story was out on this the Saturday of our present narrative. In
      the order of writing, and in Henry's plans, it should have been <i>The
      Cauliflowers of the Caliph</i>. But Bob McGibbon, hanging wearily over the
      form in the press room late Friday night, suddenly hit on the notion of
      putting <i>Sinbad the Treasurer</i> in its place. He had all but the last
      one or two in type by that time. There were no mechanical difficulties;
      and he didn't consult the author. He could hit Charlie Waterhouse harder
      this way. <i>The Cauliflowers</i> was quietly humorous; while <i>Sinbad
      the Treasurer</i> had a punch. That was how McGibbon put it to the
      foreman, Jimmy Albers. The word 'punch' was fresh slang then. McGibbon
      himself introduced it into Sunbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had Charlie and the town money in the back of his head, of course,
      when he wrote <i>Sinbad</i>. Probably more than he himself knew. McGibbon
      sniffed a sensation in the brief, vivid narrative. And a sensation of some
      sort he had to have. It was now or never with McGibbon.... He was able
      even to chuckle at the way Charlie would froth. He couldn't admit that the
      coat fitted, of course. He would just have to froth. It was Henry's <i>naïveté</i>
      that made the thing so perfect. An older man wouldn't have dared. Henry
      had just naturally rushed in. Yes, it was perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bob McGibbon was a hustler. And his nervous quickness of perception had
      brought him a few small successes and was to bring him larger ones. His
      Sunbury disaster was perhaps later to be charged to education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roots of that particular failure went deep. From first to last his
      attitude was that of a New Yorker in a small town. He outraged every local
      prejudice; he alienated, one by one, each friendly influence. He couldn't
      understand that any such village as Sunbury resents the outsider who
      insists on pointing out its little human failings. It was recognised here
      and there as possible that old man Boice and Mr Weston of the bank might
      be covering up something in the matter of the genial town treasurer; but
      there was reason enough to believe that Mr Boice and Mr Weston knew pretty
      well what they were about. That, at least, was the rather equivocal
      position into which McGibbon by his very energy and assertiveness, drove
      many a ruffled citizen.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it had needed very little urging on the part of the three leading
      citizens (McGibbon had a trick of referring to them in his paper as 'the
      Old Cinch') to bring about the boycott on the part of the Simpson Street
      and South Sunbury advertisers. As Charlie Waterhouse himself put it:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'It ain't what he says about me. I can stand it. Man to man I can attend
      to him. The thing is, he's hurtin' the town. That's it&mdash;he's hurtin'
      the town.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have spoken of McGibbon's perception. He knew before reading three
      paragraphs that Henry had a touch of genius. Before finishing <i>A
      Kerbstone Barmecide</i> he knew&mdash;knew with a mental grasp that was
      pitifully wasted on the petty business of a country weekly&mdash;that
      nothing comparable had appeared anywhere in the English-speaking world
      since <i>Plain Tales from the Hills and Soldiers Three</i>. He knew,
      further, what no Sunbury seems ever able to recognise, that it is your
      occasional Henry who, as he mentally put it, 'rings the bell.' A queer
      young man, slightly dudish in dress, unable to fit in any conventional
      job, unable really to fall into step with his generation, blunderingly but
      incorrigibly a non-conformist, a moodily earnest yet absurdly susceptible
      young man, slightly self-conscious, known here and there among those of
      his age as 'sarcastic,' brilliant occasionally, dogged some of the time,
      dreamy and irresponsible the rest, yet with charm. A youth who not
      infrequently was guilty of queer, rather unsocial acts; not of meanness or
      unkindness, rather of an inability to feel with and for others, to fit. A
      youth destined to work out his salvation, if at all, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, McGibbon read the signs shrewdly. For which Sunbury owes that erratic
      editor a small debt that remains unpaid and unrecorded to-day. No doubt
      that McGibbon brought him out. Encouraged him, spurred him, held him to
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was tradition in Sunbury that the two weekly papers should come
      decorously into the world each Saturday morning for the first delivery of
      mail. A small pile of each, toward noon was put on sale in Jackson's book
      store (formerly B. F. Jones's). That was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was why McGibbon was able, on this Saturday of our story, to
      shake the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor old Sunbury was shaken heavily and often that summer. First by the
      Mamie Wilcox scandal. The sort of thing that didn't, couldn't happen. Men
      leaving town, and all that. A miserable, hastily contrived marriage.
      Henry's name dragged in, unjustly (as it happened), but convincingly.
      Though Henry always worked best after some sort of a blow. He had to be
      shaken out of himself. I think. It isn't likely that he could or would
      have written <i>Satraps of the Simple</i> if this particular blow hadn't
      fallen. It was a feverish job. He was stung, quivering, helpless. And then
      his great gift functioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Madame Watt happened to Sunbury. And shook the village to its roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came Bob McGibbon's last and mightiest effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all commuting Sunbury converged on the old red brick 'depot' that
      morning for the seven-eleven and the seven forty-six and the eight-three
      and the eight-twenty-nine, hoarsely bellowing newsboys held the two ends
      of the platform. They wore cotton caps with 'The Weekly Gleaner' printed
      around the front. They were big, deep-throated roughs, the sort that shout
      'extras' through the cities. They crowded the local newsdealer, little Mr
      Beamer, back into one of the waiting-rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      They fairly intimidated the town. People bought the <i>Gleaner</i> in
      self-defence, even boarded trains and rode off to Chicago without their
      regular <i>Tribune</i> or <i>Record</i> or <i>Inter Ocean</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other newsmen roamed the shady, pleasant residence streets, bellowing.
      Housewives, old gentlemen, servants, hurried out to buy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were posters on the fences, and, along the billboards from Rockwell
      Park on the south to Borea on the north. McGibbon actually rented the
      space from the Northern Billboard Company. And there were newsmen with
      caps, in the afternoon, attacking the North Shore home-comers in the
      Chicago station, the very heart of things. All this&mdash;posters
      screaming like the news-men; big wood type, red and black&mdash;to
      advertise <i>Sinbad the Treasurer</i> and the rest of the long series and
      Henry Calverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Attack' is the word. McGibbon was assaulting the town and the region as
      it had hardly been assaulted before. If it was his last, it was surely his
      most outrageous act from the local point of view. People talked, boiled,
      raged. The blatancy of the thing irritated them to the point of impotent
      mutterings. They were helpless. McGibbon was breaking no laws. He was
      stirring them, however feverish his condition of mind, with deliberate
      intent. It was his notion of advertising. Reaching the mark, regardless of
      obstacles, indifference, difficulties. And had his personal circumstances
      been less harrowing he could have chuckled happily at the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise fell upon the ear drums of Charlie Waterhouse as he walked
      down-town. A ragged, red-faced pirate thrust a <i>Gleaner</i> into his
      hand, snatched his nickel, and rushed off, bellowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie began reading <i>Sinbad the Treasurer</i> as he walked. He
      finished it standing on the turf by the sidewalk, ignoring passing
      acquaintances, nervously biting and mouthing a cigar that had gone out. In
      the same condition he read bits of it again. He stood for a while,
      wavering; then went back home, and spoke roughly to Mrs Waterhouse when
      she asked him why. He hid the paper from her, to no particular purpose. He
      didn't appear at the town hall all day, but caught a trolley into Chicago
      and went to a dime museum. Later in the day he was seen by two venturesome
      youths sitting alone in the rear of a stage box at Sam T. Jack's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Norton P. Boice became aware of the sensation on his familiar way to the
      <i>Voice</i> office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey, at his own editorial desk behind the railing, waited, apparently
      buried in galley proofs, for the explosion. He had caught it all after
      leaving Henry at Stanley's door, and had prowled a bit, taking it in.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Boice simply made little sounds&mdash;'Hmm!' and 'mmp!' and 'Hmm!'
      again. Then, slowly lifting his ponderous figure, the upper half of his
      face expressionless as always above his long yellowish-white beard, went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an hour he was shut up with Mr Weston in the director's room at the
      bank; his huge bulk disposed in an armchair; little, low-voiced, neatly
      bearded Mr Weston standing by the mantel. It came down to this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Could throw him into bankruptcy. He must be about broke.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Boice. 'We'd get the stories that way. Suppress 'em.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman was still wincing from the artlessly subtle stabs he had
      suffered a week back in <i>The Caliph of Simpson Street</i>. Everybody
      within four miles of the postoffice knew who the Caliph was. He had caught
      people hiding their smiles. Mentally he was considering a new drawn head
      for the <i>Voice</i>, with the phrase 'And <i>The Weekly Gleaner</i>'
      neatly printed just below. There never had been room for two papers in
      Sunbury anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Weston was shaking his head. 'May as well sit tight, Nort. What harm's
      to be done, is done already. He'll have to come down. We'll get him then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You haven't got any of his paper here, have you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was one note. I called that some time ago.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wha'd he do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Paid it. He seems still to have a little something. But he can't last.
      Not without advertising.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But he's selling his paper fast. If he can keep that up maybe he'll begin
      to pick up a little along the street.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Weston was still shaking his head. 'Better wait, Nort.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I'll offer him a few hundred. The old <i>Gleaner</i> plant's worth
      something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, there's no harm in that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr Boice crossed the street to Hemple's market and laboriously lifted
      his great body up the stairway beside it to the quarters of the <i>Gleaner</i>
      upstairs, where a coatless, rumpled, rather wild-eyed McGibbon listened to
      him and then, with suspiciously, alert and smiling politeness, showed him
      out and down again.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sensation struck Henry, full face, in the barber shop, Schütz and
      Schwartz's, whither he went from Stanley's. Professor Hennis, of the
      English department at the university, met him at the door and insisted on
      shaking hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      'These sketches of yours, Calverly&mdash;the two I have read&mdash;are
      remarkable. There is a freshness of characterisation that suggests Chaucer
      to me. Sunbury will live to be proud of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This left Henry red and mumbling, rather dumbfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the chair, Bill Schwartz&mdash;fat, exuberant&mdash;said, bending
      over him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, how does it feel to be famous, Henry?' And added, 'You've got 'em
      excited along the street here. Henry Berger says Charlie Waterhouse'll
      punch your head before night. Says he'll have to. Can't sue very well.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It was after this and a few other evidences of the stir he was causing
      that Henry, as Humphrey had done a half-hour earlier, went prowling. He
      watched and followed the bellowing newsmen. He observed the lively scene
      at the depot when the nine-three train pulled out, from the cluttered-up
      window of Murphy's cigar store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, keeping off Simpson Street, which was by this time crowded with the
      Saturday morning shopping, he slipped around Hemple's corner and up the
      stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon sat alone in the front office&mdash;coat off, vest open, longish
      hair tousled, a lock straggling down across his high forehead, eyes
      strained and staring. He was deep in his swivel chair; long legs stretched
      out under the desk, smoking a five-cent cigar, hands deep in pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted Henry with a wry, thin-lipped smile, and waved his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great days!' he remarked dryly. 'Gee!' Henry dropped into a chair, laid
      his bamboo stick on the table, mopped a glistening face. 'Gee! You do know
      how to get'em going!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The cigar waved again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure! Stir'em up! Soak it to'em! Only way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Everybody's buying it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rather! You're a hit, son!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I don't know's I'd say that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rats! You're a knockout. Never been anything like it. Two months of it
      and they'd be throwing your name around in Union Square, N.Y. If we only
      had the two months.' He sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why!' Henry, all nerves, caught his expression. 'What's the matter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We're-out of paper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean to print on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      A nod. 'And we're out of money to buy more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But with this big sale&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Costing four 'n' one-half times what we take in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I don't see&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you? That's business, Hen. That's this world. You pour your money
      in&mdash;whip up your sales&mdash;drive, drive, <i>drive!</i> After a
      while it goes of itself and you get your money back. Scads of it. You're
      rich. That's the way with every young business. Takes nerve I tell you,
      and vision! Why, I know stories of the early days of&mdash;look here, what
      we need is money. Got to have it. Right now, while they're on the run. If
      we can't get it, and get it quick, well'&mdash;he reached deliberately
      forward, picked up a copy of the <i>Gleaner</i> and waved it high&mdash;'that&mdash;that,
      my son, is the last copy of the <i>Gleaner!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stared with burning eyes out of a white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But my stories!' he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They go to the man that gets the paper. If we land in bankruptcy, as we
      doubtless shall, they will be held by the court as assets.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But they're mine!' A note of bewilderment that was despair was in Henry's
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Hen. We're known to have them. They're in type here. You're helpless.
      We're both helpless. The thousand dollars you put in, too. You hold my
      note for that. You'll get so many cents on the dollar when the plant is
      sold at auction. Or if Boice buys it. He was up here just now. Offered me
      five hundred dollars. Think of it&mdash;five hundred for our plant, the
      big press and everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wha&mdash;wha'd you say?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Showed him out. Laughed at him. Of course! But it was just a play. Never.
      Now look here, Hen, you've got a little more, haven't you? Your uncle&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had reached the limits of his emotional capacity.' He was far beyond
      the familiar mental process known as thinking. He was sitting on the edge
      of his chair, knees drawn up, hands clasped tightly, temples drumming, a
      flush spreading down over his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even in this condition, thoughts came.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these&mdash;or perhaps it was just a feeling, a manifestation of a
      sort of instinct&mdash;was of hostility to Bob here. It. brought a touch
      of guilty discomfort&mdash;hostility came hard, with Henry&mdash;yet it
      was distinctly there. Bob was doubtless right. All his experience. And his
      wonderful fighting nerve. Yet somehow he wouldn't do.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' said Henry. And again, 'No! Not a cent from my uncle!'
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon's hand still held up the paper. He brought it down now with a
      bang. On the desk. And sprang up, speaking louder, with quick, intense
      gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You don't seem to get it, Hen!' he cried. 'We're through&mdash;broke!' He
      glanced around at the press-room door and controlled his voice. 'No
      pay-roll&mdash;nothing! Nothing for the boys out there&mdash;or me&mdash;or
      you. I've been sitting here wondering how I can tell'em. Got to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing!' Henry echoed weakly, fumbling at his Little moustache&mdash;'for
      me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not a cent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;' Henry's earthly wealth at the moment was
      about forty cents. His rough estimate of immediate expenditures was
      considerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Got to have money now, Hen! To-day. Before night. Can't you get hold of
      that fact? Even a hundred&mdash;the pay-roll's only ninety-six-fifty. If I
      could handle that, likely I could make a turn next week and get our paper
      stock in time.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry heard his own voice saying:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'But don't business men borrow&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Borrow! Me? In this town? They wouldn't lend me the rope to hang myself
      with... Hold on there, Hen&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      For the young man had picked up his stick and was moving toward the door.
      And as he hurried out he was saving, without looking back:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'No... No!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it on the stairs, where none could hear. He rushed around the
      corner, around the block. Anything to keep off Simpson Street. He had a
      really rather desperate struggle to keep from talking his heart out&mdash;aloud&mdash;in
      the street&mdash;angrily&mdash;attacking Boice, Weston, and McGibbon in
      the same breath. His feeling against McGibbon amounted to bitterness now.
      But his feeling against old Boice had risen to the borders of rage. He
      thought of that silent, ponderous old man, sitting at his desk in the
      post-office, like a spider weaving his subtle web about the town, where
      helpless little human flies crawled innocently about their uninspired
      daily tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr Boice had offered five hundred for plant, good will, and the
      stories!
    </p>
    <p>
      No mere legal, technical claim on those stories as property, as assets,
      held the slightest interest for Henry. He couldn't understand that. They
      were his. He had created them, made them out of nothing&mdash;just a few
      one-cent lead pencils and a lot of copy paper. Bob had snatched them away
      to print them in the <i>Gleaner</i>. But they weren't Bob's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They're mine!' he said aloud. 'They're mine! Old Boice shan't have them!
      Never!' He caught himself then; looked about sharply, all hot emotion and
      tingling nerves.
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      A little later&mdash;it was getting on toward noon&mdash;he found himself
      on Filbert Avenue approaching Simpson Street. Without plan or guidance, he
      was heading northward, toward the rooms. It would be necessary to cross
      Simpson Street. He was fighting down the impulse to go several blocks to
      the east, toward the lake, where the stores and shops gave place to homes
      and lawns and shade trees, where he could slip across unnoticed; but his
      feet were leading him straight toward the corner of Filbert and Simpson,
      the busiest, most conspicuous corner in town, where were the hotel and
      Berger's grocery and, only a few doors off, Donovan's drug store and
      Swanson's flower shop and Duneen's general store and the <i>Voice</i>
      office. It had come down, the warfare within him, to a question of proving
      to himself that he wasn't a coward, that he could face disaster, even the
      complete disaster that seemed now to be upon him. It was like the end of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a pocket his fingers were tightly clasped about the anonymous note that
      had been the cloud over his troubled sleep of the night and his gloomy
      awakening of the morning. The note was now but a detail in the general
      crash. He decided to press on, march straight across Simpson Street, head
      high. He even brought out the note from his pocket; held it in his hand as
      he walked stiffly on. It was a somewhat bitter touch of bravado, but I
      find I like Henry none the less for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little way short of the corner, it must be recorded, he faltered. It was
      by Berger's rear door. There was a gate in the fence here, that now stood
      open. Two of the Berger delivery wagons were backed in there. And right by
      the gate Henry Berger himself, his ample person enveloped in a long white
      apron, was opening a crate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sensed him there; flushed (for it seemed that he could not speak to
      any human being now) and wrestled, in painful impotence of will, with the
      idea of moving on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, through a slow moment after Mr Berger said, 'How are you,
      Henry!' he sensed something further; a note of good nature in the voice, a
      feeling that the man was smiling, a suggestion that all the genial quality
      had not, after all, been hardened out of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned; pulled at his moustache (paper in hand), and flicked at weeds
      with his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Berger <i>was</i> smiling. He drew his hand across a sweaty brow; shook
      the hand; then leaned on his hatchet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Getting hot,' he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry tried to reply, but found himself still inarticulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Old Boice is getting after you. Plenty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry winced; but felt slightly reassured when Mr Berger chuckled. All
      intercourse with Mr Berger was tempered, however, by the memory that Henry
      had been caught, within the decade, stealing fruit from the cases out
      front.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He was just here. Don't mind telling you that he's trying to get
      McGibbon's creditors together and throw him into bankruptcy. Doesn't look
      as if there was enough out against him, though. Got to be five hundred. It
      ain't as if he had a family and was running up bills. Just living alone at
      the Wombasts, like he does. But old Boice is out gunning for fair. Never
      saw him quite like this. First it was the advertising boycott...'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was shifting his weight from foot to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well,' he said now, 'I guess I'd better be getting along.'

      'I was just going to say, Henry, that you've give me a good laugh. Keep on
      like this and you'll be famous some day.... And say! Hold on a minute! I
      don't know's you're in a position to do anything about it, but I was just
      going to say, I rather guess the old <i>Gleaner</i> could be picked up for
      next to nothing right now. And there's folks here that ain't so anxious to
      see Boice get the market all to hisself. Not so dam anxious.... Wait a
      minute! I mean, I guess once McGibbon was got rid of the Old Boy'd find it
      wouldn't be so easy to hold this boycott together. There's folks that
      would break away&mdash;&mdash; Well, that's about all that was on my mind.
      Only I'd sorta hate to see your yarns suppressed. They're grand reading,
      Henry. My wife like to 'a' died over that one last week&mdash;<i>The
      Sultan of Simpson Street</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Caliph!&rdquo;' said Henry, with a nervous eagerness. '<i>The Caliph of
      Simpson Street</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Touched up old Norton P. for fair. Made him sorer 'n a goat. My wife's
      literary, and she says it's worthy of Poe. And you ought to hear the
      people talking to-day about this new one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>Sinbad the Treasurer!</i>' said Henry quickly, fearing another
      misquotation:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yay-ah. That. Ain't had time to read it yet myself. They say it's great.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;good-bye,' said Henry, and moved stiffly away toward the
      corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Funny!' mused the grocer,' looking after him. 'These geniuses never have
      any business sense. I give him a real opening there.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      Simpson Street was always crowded of a Saturday morning with thoughtful
      housewives. The grocers and butchers bustled about. The rows of display
      racks along the sidewalk were heaped with fresh vegetables and fruits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of the shoppers came afoot, but the kerb was lined with
      buggies, surries, neat station wagons and dog-carts, crowded in between
      the delivery wagons. Sunbury boasted, as well, a number of Stanhopes, a
      barouche or two, and several landaus. The Jenkins family, among its
      several members, had a stable full of horses and ponies. William B. Snow
      owned a valuable chestnut team with silver-mounted harness. Here and there
      along the street one might have seen, on this occasion, several vehicles
      that might well have been described as smart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sunbury had never seen anything like the equipage that, at a quarter
      to twelve&mdash;a little late for selective shopping in those days&mdash;came
      rolling smoothly, silently, on its rubber-shod wheels across the tracks
      and past the post-office, Nelson's bakery, the Sunbury National Bank,
      Duneen's and Donovan's to Swanson's flower shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never, never had Sunbury seen anything quite like that. Mr Berger,
      hurrying through to the front of his store, stopped short, stared out
      across the street and after a breathless moment breathed the words, 'Holy
      Smoke!' Women stood motionless, holding heads of lettuce, boxes of
      raspberries and what not, and gazed in an amazement that was actually long
      minutes in reaching the normal mental state of critical appraisal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was a Victoria, hung very low, varnished work glistening
      brilliantly in the sunshine. It was upholstered conspicuously in plum
      colour. The horses were jet black, glossy, perfectly matched, checked up
      so high that the necks arched prettily if uncomfortably; and they had
      docked tails. The harness they wore was mounted with a display of silver
      that made the silver on William B. Snow's team, standing just below
      Donovan's, look outright inconspicuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning back in luxurious comfort as the carriage came so softly along the
      street, holding up a parasol of black lace, overshadowing her niece,
      pretty little Cicely Hamlin, who sat beside her, Madame Watt, her large
      person dressed with costly simplicity in black with a touch of colour at
      the throat, square of face, with an emphatic chin, a strongly hooked nose,
      penetrating black eyes, surveyed the street with a commanding dignity, an
      assertive dignity, if the phrase may be used. Or it may have been that a
      touch of self-consciousness within her showed through the enveloping
      dignity and made you think about it. Certainly there was a final
      outstanding reason for self-consciousness, even in the case of Madame
      Watt; for on the high box in front visible for blocks above the traffic of
      the street, sat, in wooden perfection as in plum-coloured livery, side by
      side, a coachman and a footman.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Swanson's the footman leaped nimbly down and stood rigid by the step
      while Madame heavily descended and passed across the walk and into the
      shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      The street lifted. Women's tongues moved briskly. Trade was resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretty girl in the most wonderful carriage ever seen&mdash;a new girl,
      at that, bringing a stir of quickened interest to the younger set&mdash;is
      a magnet of considerable attracting power. Young people appeared&mdash;from
      nowhere, it seemed&mdash;and clustered about the carriage. Two couples
      hurried from the soda fountain in Donovan's. The de Casselles boys were
      passing on their way from the Country Club courts (which were still on the
      old grounds, down near the lake) in blazer coats and with expensive
      rackets in wooden presses. Alfred Knight was out collecting for the bank,
      and happened to be near. Mary Ames and Jane Bellman came over from
      Berger's, where Mary was scrutinising cauliflowers with a cool eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this moment that Henry reached the corner by Berger's, paused,
      hopelessly, confused and torn in the swirl of success and disaster that
      marked this painful day, fighting down that mad impulse to talk out loud
      his resentments in a passionate torrent of words, saw the carriage, the
      girl in it and the crowd about it in one nervous glance, then, suddenly
      pale, lips tightly compressed, moved doggedly forward across the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had nearly reached the opposite kerb&mdash;not turning; with the ugly
      little note that was clasped in his left hand, he could not trust himself
      to bow, he felt a miserable sort of relief that the distance might excuse
      his appearing not to see; and there had to be an excuse, or it would look
      to some like cowardice&mdash;when an errant summer breeze wandered around
      the corner and seized on his straw hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt it lifting; dropped his stick; reached then after both hat and
      stick and in doing so nearly dropped the paper. In another moment he was
      to be seen, desperately white, stick in one hand, a slip of paper in the
      other, running straight down Simpson Street after his hat, which whirled,
      sailed, rolled, sailed again, circled, and settled in the dust not two
      rods from the Watt carriage. The street, as streets, will, turned to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry lunged for the hat. It lifted, and rolled a little way on. He lunged
      again. It whirled over and over, then rolled rapidly straight down the
      street, just missing the hoofs of a delivery horse, passing under Mr
      George F. Smith's buggy without touching either horse or wheels, and
      sailed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry fell to one knee in his second plunge. And his pallor gave place to
      a hot flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughter came to his ears&mdash;jeering laughter. And it came
      unquestionably from the group about the Watt carriage. The first voices
      were masculine. Before he could get to his feet one or two of the girls
      had joined in. In something near despair of the spirit, helplessly, he
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole group, still laughing, turned away. All, that is, but one.
      Cicely was not laughing. She was leaning a little forward, looking right
      at him, not even smiling, her lips parted slightly. He was too far gone
      even to speculate as to what her expression meant. It fell upon him as the
      final blow. He ran on and on. In front of Hemple's market a boy stopped
      the hat with his foot. Henry, trembling with rage, took it from him,
      muttered a word of thanks, and rushed, followed by curious eyes, around
      the corner to the north.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Humphrey found him, a little before one, at the rooms, and thought he
      looked ill. He was sitting on the edge of his bed, staring at a small
      newspaper clipping. He looked up, through his doorway, saw his friend
      standing in the living-room, mumbled a colourless greeting, and let his
      heavy eyes fall again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's all this?' asked Humphrey, with a rather weary, wrinkly smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry got up then and came slowly into the living-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's this,' he explained, in a voice that was husky and light, without
      its usual body. 'This thing. I've had it quite a while.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Positively No Commission HEIRS CAN BORROW On or sell their individual
      estate, income or future inheritance; lowest rates; strictly confidential
      Heirs' Loan Office.
    </p>
    <p>
      And an address.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What on earth are you doing with this, Hen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Hump, there's still a little more'n three thousand dollars in my
      legacy. I got a thousand this summer, you know, and lent it to McGibbon
      for my interest in the paper. But my uncle said he wouldn't give me a cent
      more until I'm twenty-one, in November. And so I was wondering... Look
      here! How much do you suppose I could get out of it from these people.
      They're all right, you see?
    </p>
    <p>
      They've got a regular office and&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd just about get out with your underwear and shoes, Hen. They might
      leave you a necktie. What do you want it for&mdash;throw it in after the
      thousand?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, McGibbon's broke&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know. They're saying on the street that Boice has got the <i>Gleaner</i>
      already. Two compositors and your foreman were in our place half an hour
      ago asking for work. Boice went right down there. I saw him start climbing
      the stairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's his second trip this morning, then, Hump. He offered Bob five
      hundred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it ought to be worth a few thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure. And except for there not being any money it's going great. You'd be
      surprised! You know it's often that way. Bob says many a promising
      business has gone under just because they didn't have the money to tide it
      over a tight place. But he's getting the circulation. You've no idea! And
      when you get that you're bound to get the advertisers. Sooner or later.
      Bob says they just have to fall in line.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey appeared to be only half listening to this eager little torrent
      of words. He deliberately filled his pipe; then moved over to a window and
      gazed soberly out at the back yard of the parsonage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, moody again, was staring at the advertisement, fairly hypnotising
      himself with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Great to think of the Old Man having to climb those stairs twice,'
      Humphrey remarked, without turning. Then: 'Even with all the trouble
      you're going through, Hen, you're lucky not to be working for Boice. He
      does wear on one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He smoked the pipe out. Then, brow's knit, his long swarthy face wrinkled
      deeply with thought, he walked slowly over to the door of his own bedroom
      and leaned there, studying the interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There's three thousand dollars' worth of books in here,' he remarked. 'Or
      close to it. Even at second hand they'd fetch something. You see, it's
      really a well built, pretty complete little scientific library. Now come
      downstairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to say it again: 'Come on downstairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry followed, then; hardly aware of the oddity of Humphrey's actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the half-light that sifted dustily in through the high windows, the
      metal lathes, large and small, the tool benches, the two large reels of
      piano wire, the rows of wall boxes filled with machine jars, the round
      objects that might have been electric motors hanging by twisted strings or
      wires from the ceiling joists, the heavy steel wheels of various sizes
      mounted in frames, some with wooden handles at one side, the big box kites
      and the wood-and-silk planes stacked at one end of the room, the gas
      engine mounted at the other end, the water motor in a corner, the wheels,
      shafts and belting overhead&mdash;all were indistinct, ghostly. And all
      were covered with dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      'See!' Humphrey waved his pipe. 'I've done no work here for six weeks. And
      I shan't do any for a good while. I can't. It takes leisure&mdash;long-evenings&mdash;Sundays
      when you aren't disturbed by a soul. And at that it means years and years,
      working as I've had to. You know, getting out the <i>Voice</i> every week.
      You know how it's been with me, Hen. People are going to fly some day,
      Hen. As sure as we're walking now. Pretty soon. Chanute&mdash;Langley&mdash;they
      know! Those are Chanute gliders over there. By the kites. I've never told
      you; I've worked with 'em, moonlight nights, from the sand-dunes away up
      the beach. I've got some locked in an old boat-house up there, Hen'&mdash;he
      stood, very tall, a reminiscent, almost eager light in eyes that had been
      dull of late, a gaunt strong hand resting affectionately on a gyroscope&mdash;'I've
      flown over six hundred feet! Myself! Gliding, of course. Got an awful
      ducking, but I did it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it takes money, Hen. I've thought I could be an inventor and do my
      job besides. Maybe I could. Maybe some day I'll succeed at it. But I've
      just come to see what it needs. Material, workmen, time&mdash;Hen, you've
      got to have a real shop and a real pay-roll to do it right. And...
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I'm not telling you the truth, Hen! Not the real truth!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He took to walking around now, making angular gestures. Henry, watching
      him, coming slowly alive now to the complex life that was flowing around
      him, found himself confronted by a new, disturbed Humphrey. He had, during
      the year and more of their friendship, taken him for granted as an older,
      steadier influence, had leaned on him more than he knew. He had been a
      rock for the erratic Henry to cling to in the confusing, unstable swirl of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen'&mdash;Humphrey turned on him&mdash;'you don't know, but I'm going to
      be married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's jaw sagged.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's Mildred, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's going to be hard on the little woman, Hen. She's got to get her
      divorce. She can't take money from her husband, of course; and she's only
      got a little. She'll need me.' His voice grew a thought unsteady; he waved
      his pipe, as if to indicate and explain the machinery. 'We've got to
      strike out&mdash;take the plunge&mdash;you know, make a little money. It's
      occurred to me... This machinery's worth more than the library, in a
      pinch. And I've got two bonds left. Just two. They're money, of
      course...... Hen, you said you <i>lent</i> that thousand to McGibbon?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded. 'He gave me his note.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Let's see it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry ran up the stairs, and returned with a pasteboard box file, which,
      not without a momentary touch of pride in his quite new business sense, he
      handed to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey glanced at the carefully printed-out phrase on the back&mdash;'Henry
      Calverly, 3rd. Business Affairs'&mdash;but did not smile. He opened it and
      ran through the indexed leaves. It appeared to be empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look under &ldquo;Me,&rdquo;' said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The note was there. 'For three months,' Humphrey mused aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he smiled. There was a whimsical touch in Humphrey that his few
      friends knew and loved. Even in this serious crisis it did not desert him.
      I believe it was even stronger then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hen,' he said, 'got a quarter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile seemed to restore the rock that Henry had lately clung to. He
      found himself returning the smile, faintly but with a growing warmth. He
      replied, 'Just about.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Match me!' cried Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'To settle a very important point. Somebody's name has got to come first.
      Best two out of three.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But I don't&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Match me! No&mdash;it's mine!... Now I'll match you&mdash;mine again! I
      win. Well&mdash;that's settled!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's settled? I don't&mdash;&mdash;-'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey sat on a tool bench; swung his legs; grinned. 'Life moves on,
      Hen,' he said. 'It's a dramatic old world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Henry, puzzled, looking at him, laughed excitedly.
    </p>
    <h3>
      8
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was two o'clock in the afternoon. Simpson Street was quiet after the
      brisk business of the morning. The air quivered up from the pavement in
      the still heat. The occasional people about the street moved slowly. The
      collars of the few visible tradesmen were soft rags around their necks and
      they mopped red faces with saturated handkerchiefs. The morning breeze had
      died; the afternoon breeze would drift in at four o'clock or so; until
      which time Sunbury ladies took their naps and Sunbury business men dozed
      at their desks. Saturday closing had not made much headway at this period,
      though the still novel game of golf was beginning to work its mighty
      change in small-town life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this calm scene, absorbed in their affairs, unaware of the heat,
      strode Humphrey and Henry&mdash;down past the long hotel veranda, where
      the yellow rocking chairs stood in endless empty rows, past Swanson's and
      Donovan's and Jackson's book store to the meat market and then, rapidly,
      up the long stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found McGibbon with his long legs stretched out under his desk, hands
      deep in pockets, thin face lined and weary, but eyes nervously bright as
      always. He was in his shirt-sleeves, of course. His drab brown hair seemed
      a little longer and even more ragged than usual where it met his wilted
      collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he grinned at them, and waved a long hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My God!' he cried, 'but it's good to see a human face. Look!' His hand
      swept around, indicating the dusty, deserted desks and the open press-room
      door. It was still out there; not a man hummed or whistled as he clicked
      type into his stick, not one of the four job presses rumbled out its
      cheerful drone of industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Rats all gone!' McGibbon added. 'But the Caliph was up again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' Henry, who found himself suddenly and deeply moved, breathed
      softly, 'we know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Came up a hundred. He'll pay six hundred now. For all this. An actual
      investment of more'n four thousand.' The hand waved again. 'It's amusing.
      He doesn't know I'm on to him. You see the old fox's been nosing around to
      get up a petition to throw me into involuntary bankruptcy, but he can't
      find any creditors. Has to be five hundred dollars, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What did you say to him?' asked Humphrey, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Showed him out. Second time to-day. It was a hard climb for him, too. He
      did puff some.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey slowly drew a large envelope from an inner pocket and laid it on
      the table at his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon eyed it alertly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here!' he said, his hand moving up toward the row of four or five cigars
      that projected from a vest pocket, 'smoke up, you fellows.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry shook his head. Humphrey drew out his pipe; then raised his head,
      and said quietly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There came the unmistakable sound of heavy feet on the stairs. Steadily,
      step by step, a slowly moving body mounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, framed in the doorway, stood the huge bulk of Norton P. Boice,
      breathless, red, and wet of face, his old straw hat pushed back, his
      yellowish-white, wavy beard covering his necktie and the upper part of his
      roundly protruding, slightly spotted vest, against which the heavy watch
      chain with its dangling fraternal insignia stood out prominently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boice's eyes, nearly expressionless, finally settled on Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What are you doing here?' he asked, between puffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's only reply was a slight impatient gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You oughta be at your desk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he came into the room. Of the three men seated there Humphrey was the
      only one who knew by certain small external signs, that the Caliph of
      Simpson Street was blazing with wrath. For here was his own hired
      lieutenant hobnobbing with the boy whose agile, irresponsible pen had made
      him the laughing stock of the township and with the intemperate rival who
      had first attacked and then defied him. And then he had just climbed the
      stairs for the third and what he meant to be the last time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came straight to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you decided to accept my offer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit down,' said McGibbon, pushing a chair over with his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boice ignored this final bit of insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you decided to accept my offer?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well'&mdash;McGibbon shrugged; spread out his hands&mdash;'I've decided
      nothing, but as it looks now I may find myself forced to accept it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I suggest that you accept it now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;&mdash;' the hands went out again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait a moment,' said Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think you had better go back to the office,' Boice broke in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shortly. I have no intention of leaving you in the lurch, Mr Boice. But
      first I have business here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>You</i> have business!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' Humphrey opened the large envelope. 'Here, McGibbon, is your note
      to Henry for one thousand dollars, due in November.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before their eyes, deliberately, he tore it up, leaned over McGibbon's
      legs with an, 'I beg your pardon!' and dropped the pieces in the
      waste-basket. Next he produced a folded document engraved in green and red
      ink. 'Here,' he concluded, 'is a four per cent, railway bond that stands
      to-day at a hundred two and a quarter in the market. That's our price for
      the <i>Gleaner</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      McGibbon's nervous eyes followed the movements of Humphrey's hands as if
      fascinated. During the hush that followed he sat motionless, chin on
      breast. Then, slowly, he drew in his legs, straightened up, reached for
      the bond, turned it over, opened it and ran his eye over the coupons,
      looked up and remarked:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'The paper's yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then, Mr Boice,' said Humphrey, 'the next issue of the <i>Gleaner</i>
      will be published by Weaver and Calverly, and the stories you object to
      will run their course.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr Boice, creaking deliberately over the floor, was just disappearing
      through the doorway.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      9
    </h3>
    <p>
      The sunlight was streaming in through the living-room of the barn back of
      the old Parmenter place. Outside the maple leaves were rustling gently.
      Through the quiet air came the slow booming of the First Presbyterian bell
      across the block. From greater distances came the higher pitched bell of
      the Baptist Church, down on Filbert Avenue, and the faint note from the
      Second Presbyterian over on the West Side, across the tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey had made coffee and toast. They sat at an end of the centre
      table. Humphrey in bath-robe and slippers, Henry fully dressed in his blue
      serge suit, neat silk four-in-hand tie, stiff white collar and carefully
      polished shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where are you going with all that?' Humphrey asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry hesitated; flushed a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      'To church,' he finally replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's surprise was real. There had been a time, before they came to
      know each other, when the boy had sung bass in the quartet at the Second
      Presbyterian. But since that period he had not been a church-goer. Henry
      had been quiet all evening, and now this morning. He seemed all boxed up
      within himself. Preoccupied. As if the triumph over old Boice had merely
      opened up the way to new responsibilities. Which, for that matter, was
      just what it had done&mdash;done to both of them. Humphrey, not being
      given to prying, would have let the subject drop here, had not Henry
      surprised him by breaking hotly forth into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's my big fight, Hump!' he was saying now. 'Don't you see! This town.
      All they say. Look here!' He laid a rumpled bit of paper on the table. As
      if he had been holding it ready in his hand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, that letter,' said Humphrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. It's what I've got to fight. And I've got to win. Don't you see?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' Humphrey replied gravely, 'I see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think,' said Henry, 'it's being in love that's going to help me. We've
      got to hold our heads up, you and I. Build the <i>Gleaner</i> into a real
      property. Win confidence. And there mustn't be any doubt. The way we step
      out and fight, you know. I've got to stand with you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's eyes strayed to the sunlit window. He suppressed a little sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This note's right enough, in a way,' Henry went on. 'It wouldn't be fair
      to compromise her.' He leaned earnestly over the table. 'It's really a
      hopeless love. I know that, Hump. But it isn't like the others.' It makes
      me feel ashamed of them. All of them. I've got to show her, or at least
      show myself, that it's this love that has made a man of me. Without asking
      anything, you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey listened in silence as the talk ran on. The boy was changing, no
      question about that. Even back of the romantic strain that was colouring
      his attitude, the suggestion of pose in it, there was real evidence of
      this change. At least his fighting blood was up. And he was taking
      punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting there sipping his coffee, Humphrey, half listening, soberly
      considered his younger friend. Henry was distinctly odd, a square peg in a
      round world. He was capable of curiously outrageous acts, yet most of them
      seemed to arise from a downright inability to sense the common attitude,
      to feel with his fellows. He could be heedless, neglectful, self-centred;
      but Humphrey had never found meanness or unkindness in him. And he was
      capable of a passionate generosity. He had, indeed, for Humphrey, the
      fascination that an erratic and ingenuous but gifted person often exerts
      on older, steadier natures. You could be angry at him; but you couldn't
      get over the feeling that you had to take care of him. And it always
      seemed, even when he was out and out exasperating, that the thing that was
      the matter with him was the very quality that underlay his astonishing
      gifts; that he was really different from others; the difference ran all
      through, from his unexpected, rather self-centred ways of acting and
      reacting clear up to the fact that he could write what other people
      couldn't write. 'If they could,' thought Humphrey now, shrewdly, 'very
      likely they'd be different too.' Take this business of dressing up like a
      born suburbanite and going to church. It was something of a romantic
      gesture, But that wasn't all it was. The fight was real, whatever
      unexpected things it might lead him to do from day to day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert de Casselles, wooden-faced, dressed impeccably in frock coat,
      heavy 'Ascot' tie, gray striped trousers perfectly creased, (Henry had
      never owned a frock coat) ushered him half-way down the long aisle to a
      seat in Mrs Ellen F. Wilson's pew. He felt eyes on him as he walked,
      imagined whispers, and set his face doggedly against them all. He had set
      out in a sort of fervor; but now the thing was harder to do than he had
      imagined. The people looked cold and hostile. It was to be a long fight.
      He might never win. The more successful he might come to be, the more some
      of them would hate him and fight him down... It was queer, Herb de
      Casselles ushering him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The organist slid on to his seat, up in the organ loft behind the pulpit;
      spread out his music and turned up the corners; pulled and pushed on stops
      and couplers; glanced up into his narrow mirror; adjusted his tie; fussed
      again with the stops; began to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sat up stiffly, even boldly, and looked about. Across the church, in
      a pew near the front, sat the Watts: the Senator, on the aisle, looking
      curiously insignificant with his meek, red face and his little, slightly
      askew chin beard; Madame Watt sitting wide and high over him, like a stout
      hawk, chin up, nose down, beady eyes fixed firmly on the pulpit; Cicely
      Hamlin almost fragile beside her, eyes downcast&mdash;or was she looking
      at the hymns?
    </p>
    <p>
      When Cicely was talking, with her nervous eagerness, her quick smile, her
      almost Frenchy gestures, she seemed gay. When in repose, as now, her
      delicate sensitiveness, her slightly sad expression, were evident, even to
      Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Made him feel in the closing scene of <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i>, where
      he was bidding the Princess who could never be his a last farewell; the
      mere sight of her thrilled him with a deep romantic sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the prayers, the announcements, the choir numbers and collection,
      his sacrificial mood grew more and more intense. It was something of a
      question whether he could hide his emotion before all these hostile
      people. The long fight ahead to rebuild his name in the village loomed
      larger and larger, began to take on an aspect that was almost terrifying.
      For the first time to-day he felt weakness but she made him feel something
      as Sothem had made in his heart. He sat very quiet, hands clenched on his
      knees, and unconsciously thrust out his chin a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doxology was sung and his head was bowed for the benediction, he
      had to struggle with a mad impulse to rush out, run down the aisle while
      people were picking up their hats and things. The thing to do, of course,
      was to take his time, be natural, move out with the rest. This he did,
      blazing with self-consciousness, his chin forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult. Several persons&mdash;older persons, who had known his
      mother&mdash;stopped him and congratulated him on the brilliant work he
      was doing. This in the midst of the unuttered hostility that seemed like
      hundreds of little barbed darts penetrating his skin from every side. He
      could only blush and mumble. Elderly, innocent Mrs Bedford of Filbert
      Avenue actually introduced him to her nieces from Boston as a young man of
      whom all Sunbury was proud. He had to blush and mumble here for a long
      time, while the line of people crowded decorously past.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he got to the door. Stiffly raising his hat as one or two groups
      of young people recognised him, he moved out to the sidewalk. There he
      raised his eyes. They met, for a fleeting instant, but squarely, over Herb
      de Casselles' shoulder, the dark eyes of Cicely Hamlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting on the little forward seat in the black-and-plum Victoria.
      Madame Watt was settling herself in the back seat. The Senator was
      stepping in. The plum-coloured footman stood stiffly by. The plum-coloured
      driver sat stiffly on the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herb de Casselles turned, with a wry smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry raised his hat, bit his lip, hesitated, hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Mr Calverly!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to turn back. He knew he was fiery red. He knew, too, that in this
      state of tortured bewilderment he couldn't trust his tongue for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely leaned out, with outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to take it. The thrill the momentary touch of it gave, him but
      added a wrench to the torture. Then the Senator's hand had to be taken;
      finally Madame's.
    </p>
    <p>
      His pulse was racing; pounding at his temples. What did all this mean!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely, her own colour up a little, speaking quickly, her face lighting
      up, her hands moving, cried:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Mr Calverly! We heard this morning that the <i>Gleaner</i> has failed
      and that Mr Boice has it and we aren't to see your stories any more.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said Henry, a faint touch of assurance appearing in his heart, mind,
      voice, 'that isn't so. Mr Boice hasn't got it. We've got it&mdash;Humphrey
      Weaver and I.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean you have purchased it?' This from the Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yay-ah, We bought it yesterday.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No!' cried Cicely. 'Really?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yay-ah. We bought it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then,' commented the Senator, 'you must permit me indeed to congratulate
      you. It is unusual to find business acumen and enterprise combined with
      such a literary talent as yours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was pleasing, if stilted. It was beginning to be possible for Henry
      to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Cicely clinched matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You promised to come and read me the others, Mr Calverly. Oh, but you
      did! You must come. Really! Let me see&mdash;I know I shall be at home
      to-morrow evening.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, for a moment, Cicely seemed to falter. She turned questioningly to
      her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Watt certainly knew the situation. She had heard Henry discussed in
      relation to the Mamie Wilcox incident. She knew how high feeling was
      running in the village. Just what her motives were, I cannot say. Perhaps
      it was her tendency to make her own decisions and if possible to make
      different decisions from those of the folk about her. The instinct to
      stand out aggressively in all matters was strong within her. And she liked
      Henry. The flare of extreme individuality in him probably reached her and
      touched a curiously different strain of extreme individuality within
      herself. She hated sheep. Henry was not a sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Cicely's part of it, I know she had been thrilled when Henry read
      her the first ten stories. She had read more than the Sunbury girls; and
      she saw more in his oddities than they were capable of seeing. To fail in
      any degree to conform to the prevailing customs and thought was to be
      ridiculous in Sunbury. But she had no more forgotten the jeers that had
      followed Henry from this very carriage as he chased his hat down Simpson
      Street the preceding day than had Henry himself. Nor had she forgotten
      that Herbert de Casselles had been one of that unkind group. And as she
      certainly knew what she was about, despite her impulsiveness, I prefer to
      think that her action was deliberately kind and deliberately brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come to dinner,' said Madame Watt shortly but with a sort of rough
      cordiality. 'Seven o'clock. To-morrow evening. Informal dress. All right,
      Watson.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely settled back, her eyes bright; but gave Henry only the same
      suddenly impersonal little nod of good-bye that she gave Herbert de
      Casselles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman leaped to the box. The remarkable carriage rolled luxuriously
      away on its rubber tyres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry turned, grinning in foolish happiness, on the young man in the frock
      coat who had not been asked to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Walking up toward Simpson, Herb?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me&mdash;why&mdash;no, I'm going this way.' And Herb pointed hurriedly
      southward.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;so long!' said Henry, and headed northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The warm sunlight filtered down through the dense foliage. Birds twittered
      up there. The church procession moving slowly along was brightly dressed;
      pleasant to see. Henry, head up, light of foot, smiling easily when this
      or that person, after a moment's hesitation, bowed to him, listened to the
      birds, expanded his chest in answer to the mellowing sunshine, and gave
      way, with a fresh little thrill, to the thought:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must buy a frock coat for to-morrow night.'

      VIII&mdash;THIS BUD OF LOVE
    </h2>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was mid-August
      and twenty minutes to eight in the evening. The double rows of maples
      threw spreading shadows over the pavement, sidewalk and lawns of Hazel
      Avenue. From dim houses, set far back amid trees and shrubs, giving a homy
      village quality to the darkness, came through screened doors and curtained
      'bay' windows the yellow glow of oil lamps and the whiter shine of
      electric lights. Here and there a porch light softly illuminated a group
      of young people; their chatter and laughter, with perhaps a snatch of
      song, floating pleasantly out on the soft evening air. Around on a side
      street, sounding faintly, a youthful banjoist with soft fingers and
      inadequate technique was struggling with <i>The March Past</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moving in a curious, rather jerky manner along the street, now walking
      swiftly, nervously, now hesitating, even stopping, in some shadowy spot,
      came a youth of twenty (going on twenty-one). He wore&mdash;though all
      these details were hardly distinguishable even in the patches of light at
      the street corners, where arc lamps sputtered whitely&mdash;neatly pressed
      white trousers, a 'sack' coat of blue serge, a five-dollar straw hat, silk
      socks of a pattern and a silken 'four-in-hand' tie. He carried a cane of
      thin bamboo that he whipped and flicked at the grass and rattled lightly
      along the occasional picket fence except when he was fussing at the light
      growth on his upper lip. Under his left arm was a square package that any
      girl of Sunbury would have recognised instantly, even in the shadows, as a
      two-pound box of Devoe's chocolates.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you had chanced to be a resident of Sunbury at this period you would
      have known that the youth was Henry Calverly, 3rd. Though you might have
      had no means of knowing that he was about to 'call' on Cicely Hamlin. Or,
      except perhaps from his somewhat spasmodic locomotion, that he was in a
      state of considerable nervous excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that Henry hadn't called on many girls in his day. He had. But he had
      called only once before on Cicely (the other time had been that invitation
      to dinner for which her aunt was really responsible) and had then, in a
      burning glow of temperament, read her his stories!
    </p>
    <p>
      How he had read! And read! And read! Until midnight and after. She had
      been enthusiastic, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he wasn't in a glow now. Certain small incidents had lately brought
      him to the belief that Cicely Hamlin lacked the pairing-off instinct so
      common among the young of Sunbury. She had been extra nice to him; true.
      But the fact stood that she was not 'going with' him. Not in the Sunbury
      sense of the phrase. A baffling, disturbing aura of impersonally pleasant
      feeling held him at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was just a young fellow setting forth, with chocolates, to call on a
      girl. A girl who could be extra nice to you and then go out of her way to
      maintain pleasant acquaintance with the others, your rivals, your enemies.
      Almost as if she felt she had been a little too nice and wished to strike
      a balance; at least he had thought of that. A girl who had been reared
      strangely in foreign convents; who didn't know <i>The Spanish Cavalier</i>
      or <i>Seeing Nellie Home</i> or <i>Solomon Levi</i>, yet did know,
      strangely, that the principal theme in Dvorak's extremely new 'New World'
      symphony was derived from <i>Swing Low, Sweet Chariot</i> (which
      illuminating fact had stirred Henry to buy, regardless, the complete piano
      score of that symphony and struggle to pick out the themes on Humphrey's
      piano at the rooms). A girl who had never seen De Wolf Hopper in <i>Wang</i>,
      or the Bostonians in <i>Robin Hood</i>, or Sothem in The Prisoner of
      Zenda, or Maude Adams or Ethel Barrymore or <i>anything</i>. A girl who
      had none of the direct, free and easy ways of the village young; you
      couldn't have started a rough-house with her&mdash;mussed her hair, or
      galloped her in the two-step. A girl who wasn't stuck up, or anything like
      that, who seemed actually shy at times, yet subtly repressed you, made you
      wish you could talk like the fellow's that had gone to Harvard.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of these rather remarkable facts I think it really was a tribute
      to Cicely Hamlin that the many discussions of her as a conspicuous
      addition to the youngest set had boiled down to the single descriptive
      adjective, 'tactful.' Though the characterisation seems not altogether
      happy; for the word, to me, connotes something of conscious skill and
      management&mdash;as my Crabb put it: 'TACTFUL. See Diplomatic'&mdash;and
      Cicely was not, certainly not in those days, a manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, muttered softly, as he walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll hand it to her when she comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, she'll shake hands and it might get in the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Put it on the table&mdash;that's the thing!&mdash;on a corner where
      she'll see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then some time when we can't think of anything to talk about, I'll say&mdash;&ldquo;Thought
      you might like a few chocolates.&rdquo; Sorta offhand. Prevent there being a
      lull in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Better begin calling her Cicely.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why not? Shucks! Can't go on with &ldquo;You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Say!&rdquo; Why can't I just do it
      naturally? The way Herb would, or Elbow, or those fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;How'd' you do, Cicely! Come on, let's take a walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'No. &ldquo;Good-evening, Cicely. I thought maybe you'd like to take a walk.
      There's a moonrise over the lake about half-past eight.&rdquo; That's better.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wonder if Herb'll be there. He'd hardly think to come so early, though.
      Be all right if I can get her away from the house by eight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, held up his watch to the light from the corner, then rushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe she'd ask me to sit him out, anyway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But his lips clamped shut on this. It was just the sort of thing Cicely
      wouldn't do. He knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What if she won't go out!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This sudden thought brought bitterness. A snicker had run its course about
      town&mdash;in his eager self-absorption he had wholly forgotten&mdash;when
      Alfred Knight, confident in an engagement to call, had hired a horse and
      buggy at McAllister's. The matter of an evening drive <i>a deux</i> had
      been referred to Cicely's aunt. As a result the horse had stood hitched
      outside more than two hours only to be driven back to the livery, stable
      by the gloomy Al.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shucks, though! Al's a fish! Don't blame her!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked stiffly in among the trees and shrubs of the old Dexter Smith
      place and mounted the rather imposing front steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      That purchase of the Dexter Smith place was typical of Madame Watt at the
      time. She was riding high. She had money. Two acres of lawn, fine old
      trees, a great square house of Milwaukee brick, high spacious rooms with
      elaborately moulded plaster ceilings and a built-on conservatory and a
      barn that you could keep half a dozen carriages in! It was one of only
      four or five houses in Sunbury that the <i>Voice</i> and the <i>Gleaner</i>
      rejoiced to call 'mansions.' And it was the only one that could have been
      bought. The William B. Snows, like the Jenkinses and the de Casselles (I
      don't know if it has been explained before that the accepted local
      pronunciation was Dekasells,) lived in theirs. And even after the elder
      Dexter Smith died Mrs Smith would hardly have sold the place if the
      children hadn't nagged her into it. Young Dex wanted to go to New York.
      And at that it was understood that Madame Watt paid two prices.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      A uniformed butler showed Henry into the room that he would have called
      the front parlour. Though there was another much like it across the wide
      hall. There was a 'back parlour,' with portières between. Out there, he
      knew, between centre table and fireplace, the Senator and Madame might
      even now be sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened, on the edge of a huge plush and walnut chair, for the rustle
      of the Senator's paper, or Madame's deep, always startling voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no sound. Save that somewhere upstairs, far off, a door opened;
      then footsteps very faint. And silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry looked, fighting down misgivings, at the heavily framed oil
      paintings on the wall. One, of a life-boat going out through mountainous
      waves to a wreck, he had always heard was remarkably fine. Fastened over
      the bow of the boat was a bit of real rope that had provoked critical
      controversy when the picture was first exhibited in Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced down, discovered the box of chocolates on his knees, and
      hurriedly placed it on the corner of the inevitable centre table. Then he
      fussed nervously with his moustache; adjusted his tie, wondering if the
      stick pin should be higher; pulled down his cuffs; and sat up stiffly
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe she ain't home,' he thought weakly. 'That fella said he'd see.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Maybe I oughta've asked if she'd be in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence deepened, spread, settled about him. He wished she would come
      down. There was danger, he knew, that his few painfully thought-out
      conversational openings would leave him. He would be an embarrassed, quite
      speechless young man. For he was as capable, even now, at twenty, almost
      at twenty-one, of speechlessness as of volubility. Either might happen to
      him, at any moment, from the smallest, least foreseeable of causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was something oppressive about the stillness of this cavernous
      old house with its sound-proof partitions and its distances. And that
      silent machine of a butler. It wasn't like calling at Martha Caldwell's,
      in the old days, where you could hear the Swedish cook crashing around in
      the kitchen and Martha moving around upstairs before she came down. Here
      you wouldn't so much as know there was a kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, suddenly, sharp as a blow out of the stillness came a series of
      sounds that froze the marrow in his bones, made him rigid on the edge of
      that plush chair, his lips parted, his eyes staring, wrestling with an
      impulse to dash out of the house; with another impulse to cough, or shout,
      or play the piano, in some mad way to announce himself, yet continuing to
      sit like a carved idol, in the grip of a paralysis of the faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing more painful to the young than the occasional discovery,
      through the mask of social reticence, that the old have their weak or
      violent moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gossip, yes! But gossip rests lightly and briefly in young ears. Henry had
      heard the Watts slyly ridiculed. There were whispers, of course. Madame's
      career as a French countess&mdash;well, naturally Sunbury wondered. And
      the long obscurity from which she had rescued Senator Watt raised
      questions about that very quiet little man. So often men in political life
      were tempted off the primly beaten track. And Henry, like the other young
      people, had grinned in awed delight over the tale that Madame swore at her
      servants. That was before he had so much as spoken to her niece. And it
      had little or no effect on his attitude toward Madame herself when he met
      her. She had at once taken her place in the compartment of his thoughts
      reserved from earliest memory for his elders, whose word was (at least in
      honest theory) law and to whom one looked up with diffidence and a genuine
      if somewhat automatic respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first of the disturbing sounds was Madame's voice, far-off but ringing
      strong. Then a door opened&mdash;it must have been the dining-room door;
      not the wide one that opened into the great front hall, but the other, at
      the farther end of the 'back parlour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief lull. A voice could be heard, though&mdash;a man's
      voice, low-pitched, deprecatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Madame's again. And stranger noises. The man's voice cried out in
      quick protest; there was a rustle and then a crash like breaking china.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator, hurrying a little, yet with a sort of dignity, walked out
      into the hall. Henry could see him, first between the portières as he left
      the room, then as he passed the hall door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a rush and a torrent of passionately angry words from the other
      room. An object&mdash;it appeared to be a paper weight or ornament&mdash;came
      hurtling out into the hall. The Senator, who had apparently gone to the
      closet by the door for his hat and stick&mdash;for he came back into the
      hall with them&mdash;stepped back just in time to avoid being struck. The
      object fell on the stair, landing with the sound of solid metal.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You come back here!' Madame's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will not come back until you have had time to return to your senses,'
      replied the Senator. He looked very small. He was always stilted in
      speech; Humphrey had said that he talked like the <i>Congressional Record</i>.
      'This is a disgraceful scene. If you have the slightest regard for my good
      name or your own you will at least make an effort to compose yourself.
      Some one might be at the door at this moment. You are a violent,
      ungoverned woman, and I am ashamed of you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you'&mdash;she was almost screaming now&mdash;'are the man who was
      glad to marry me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He ignored this. 'If any one asks for me, I shall be at the Sunbury Club.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Going to drink again, are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I think not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'If you do, you needn't come back. Do you hear? You needn't come back!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned, and with a sort of strut went out the front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started to follow. She did come as far as the portières. Henry had a
      glimpse of her, her face red and distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned back then, and seemed to be picking up the room. He could hear
      sniffing and actually snorting as she moved about. There was a brief
      silence. Then she crossed the hall, a big imposing person&mdash;even in
      her tantrums she had presence&mdash;and went up the stairs, pausing on the
      landing to pick up the object she had thrown. Her solid footfalls died out
      on the thick carpets of the upper hall. A door opened, and slammed faintly
      shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry found that he was clutching the arms of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must relax,' he thought vacantly; and drew a slow deep breath, as he
      had been taught in a gymnasium class at the Y.M.C.A.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brushed a hand across his eyes. Now that it was over, his temples were
      pounding hotly, his nerves aquiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was incredible. Yet it had happened. Before his eyes. A vulgar brawl; a
      woman with a red face throwing things. And he was here in the house with
      her. He might have to try to talk with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered again the possibility of slipping out. But that butler had
      taken his name up. Cicely would be coming down any moment. Unless she
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she know? Had she heard? Possibly not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry got slowly, indecisively up and wandered to the piano; stood leaning
      on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes filled. All at once, in his mind's eye, he could see Cicely.
      Particularly the sensitive mouth. And the alert brown eyes. And the pretty
      way her eyebrows moved when she spoke or smiled or listened&mdash;always
      with a flattering attention&mdash;to what you were saying.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brought a clenched fist down softly on the piano.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      'Oh,' cried the voice of Cicely&mdash;'there you are! How nice of you to
      come!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was standing&mdash;for a moment&mdash;in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      White of face, eyes burning, his fist still poised on the piano, he stared
      at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn't know! Surely she didn't&mdash;not with that bright smile. __
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore the informal, girlish costume of the moment&mdash;neatly fitting
      dark skirt; simple shirt-waist with the ballooning sleeves that were then
      necessary; stiff boyish linen collar propping the chin high, and little
      bow tie; darkish, crisply waving hair brought into the best order
      possible, parted in the middle and carried around and down over the ears
      to a knot low on the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I brought some candy,' he cried fiercely. 'There! On the table!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She knit her brows for a brief moment. Then opened the box.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How awfully nice of you... You'll have some?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I don't eat candy. I was thinking of&mdash;I want to get you out&mdash;Come
      on, let's take a walk!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled a little, around a chocolate. Surely she didn't know!
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seemed, during her first days in Sunbury, rather timid at times.
      But there was in this smile more than a touch of healthy self-confidence.
      No girl, indeed, could find herself making so definite a success as Cicely
      had made here from her first day without acquiring at least the beginnings
      of self-confidence. It was a success that had forced Elbow Jenkins and
      Herb de Casselles to ignore small rebuffs and persist in fighting over
      her. It permitted her, even in a village where social conformity was the
      breath of life, to do odd, unexpected things. Such as allowing herself to
      be interested, frankly, in Henry Calverly.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she smiled as she nibbled a chocolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said it again, breathlessly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was thinking of asking you to take a walk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well'&mdash;still that smile&mdash;'why don't you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was still in a daze, and pressed stupidly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's a fine evening. And the moon'll be coming up.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll get my sweater,' she said quietly, and went out to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was just turning away from the hall closet with the sweater&mdash;he,
      hat and stick in hand, was fighting back the memory of how Senator Watt
      had marched stiffly to that same closet&mdash;when Madame Watt came down
      the stairs, scowling intently, still breathing hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw them; came toward them; stood, pursing her lips, finally forcing a
      sort of smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, howdadoo!' she remarked, toward Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her black eyes focused pointedly on him. And while he was mumbling a
      greeting, she broke in on him with this:&mdash;'I didn't know you were
      here. Did you just come?' Henry's eyes lowered. Then, as utter silence
      fell, the colour surging to his face, he raised them. They met her black,
      alarmed stare. He felt that he ought to lie about this, lie like a good
      one. But he didn't know how.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, all confusion, he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a long moment they held that gaze, the vigorous, strangely
      interesting woman of wealth and of what must have been a violent past, and
      the gifted, sensitive youth of twenty. When she turned away, they had a
      secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We thought of taking a little walk,' said Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame moved briskly away into the back parlour, merely throwing back over
      her shoulder, in a rather explosive voice: 'Have a good time!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The remark evidently struck Cicely as somewhat out of character. She even
      turned, a little distrait, and looked after, her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as they were passing out the door, Madame's voice boomed after them.
      She was hurrying back through the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'By the way,' she said, with a frowning, determined manner, 'we are having
      a little theatre party Saturday night. A few of Cicely's friends. Dinner
      here at six. Then we go in on the seven-twenty. I know Cicely'll be glad
      to have you. Informal&mdash;don't bother to dress.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes!' cried Cicely, looking at her aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;Im sure I'd be delighted,' said Henry heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went out, and strolled in rather oppressive quiet toward the
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a summer extravaganza going, at the Auditorium. That must be the
      theatre. They hadn't meant to ask him, of course. Not at this late hour.
      It hurt, with a pain that, a day or so back, would have filled Henry's
      thoughts. But Cicely's smile, as she stood by the table, nibbling a
      chocolate, the poise of her pretty head&mdash;the picture stood out
      clearly against a background so ugly, so unthinkably vulgar, that it was
      like a deafening noise in his brain.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      He glanced sidewise at Cicely. They were walking down Douglass Street.
      Just ahead lay the still, faintly shimmering lake, stretching out to the
      end of the night and beyond. Already the whispering sound reached their
      ears of ripples lapping at the shelving beach. And away out, beyond the
      dim horizon, a soft brightness gave promise of the approaching moonrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole another glance at Cicely. He could just distinguish her delicate
      profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought: 'How could she ask me? They wouldn't like it, her friends.
      Mary Ames mightn't want to come. Martha Caldwell, even. She's been nice to
      me. I mustn't make it hard for her. And she mustn't know about tonight.
      Not ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a new thought brought pain. If there had been one such scene, there
      would be others. And she would have to live against that background,
      keeping up a brave face before the prying world of Sunbury. Perhaps she
      had already lived through something of the sort. That sad look about her
      mouth; when she didn't know you were looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the boulevard now, and were standing at the railing over
      the beach. A little talk had been going on, of course, about this and that&mdash;he
      hardly knew what.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clenched his fist again, and brought it down on the iron rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh,' he broke out&mdash;'about Saturday. I forgot. I can't come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but please&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Awfully busy. You've no idea. You see Humphrey Weaver and I bought
      the <i>Gleaner</i>. I told you, didn't I? It's a big responsibility&mdash;getting
      the pay-roll every week, and things like that. Things I never knew about
      before. I don't believe I was made to be a business man. Lots of accounts
      and things. Hump's at it all the time&mdash;nights and everything. You see
      we've got to make the paper pay. We've <i>got</i> to! It was losing, when
      Bob McGibbon had it. People hated him, and they wouldn't advertise. And
      now we have to get the advertising back.' If we fail in that, we'll go
      under, just as he did...'
    </p>
    <p>
      Words! Words! A hot torrent of them! He didn't know how transparent he
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood, her two hands resting lightly on the rail, looking out at the
      slowly spreading glow in the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm so glad aunt asked you,' she said gravely. 'I wanted you to come. I
      want you to know. Won't you, please?'
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, but she didn't turn. There was more behind her words.
      Even Henry could see that. He had been discussed. As a problem. But she
      didn't say the rest of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his clumsy little artifice broke down, and the crude feeling rushed
      to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know I mustn't come!' he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' said she, with that deliberate gravity. 'I don't know that. I think
      you should.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't. You don't understand. They wouldn't like it, my being there.
      They talk about me. They don't speak to me, even.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then oughtn't you to come? Face them? Show them that it isn't true?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But that will just make it hard for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was slow in answering this; seemed to be considering it. Finally she
      replied with:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't think I care about that. People have been awfully nice to me
      here. I'm having a lovely time. But it isn't as if I had always lived here
      and expected to stay for the rest of my life. My life has been different.
      I've known a good many different kinds of people, and I've had to think
      for myself a good deal. No, I'd like you to come. If you don't come&mdash;-don't
      you see?&mdash;you're putting me with them. You're making me mean and
      petty. I don't want to be that way. If&mdash;if I'm to see you at all,
      they must know it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Perhaps, then,' he muttered, 'you'd better not see me at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I know; but&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. I want to see you. If you want to come. I love your stories. You're
      more interesting than any of them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, he turned square around; stared at her. But she, very quietly,
      finished what she had to say. 'I think you're a genius. I think you're
      going to be famous. It's&mdash;it's exciting to see the way you write
      stories.... Wait, please! I'm going to tell you the rest of it. Now that
      we're talking it out, I think I've got to. It was aunt who didn't want to
      ask you. She likes you, but she thought&mdash;well, she thought it might
      be awkward, and&mdash;and hard for you. I told her what I've told you,
      that I've either got to be your friend before all of them or not at all.
      And now that she has asked you&mdash;don't you see, it's the way I wanted
      it all along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There wasn't another girl in Sunbury who could have, or would have, made
      quite that speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked delicately beautiful in the growing light. Her hair was a
      vignetted halo about her small head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, staring, his hands clenched at his sides, broke out with:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I love you!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh&mdash;h!' she breathed. 'Please!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Words came from him, a jumble of words. About his hopes, the few thousand
      dollars that would be his on the seventh of November, when he would be
      twenty-one, the wonderful stories he would write, with her for
      inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly he was in a panic. He hadn't dreamed of saying such a thing.
      Never before, in all his little philanderings had he let go like this,
      never had he felt the glow of mad catastrophe that now seemed to be
      consuming him. Oh, once perhaps&mdash;something of it&mdash;years back&mdash;when
      he had believed he was in love with Ernestine Lambert. But that had been
      in another era. And it hadn't gone so deep as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anyway'&mdash;he heard her saying, in a rather tired voice&mdash;'anyway&mdash;it
      makes it hard, of course&mdash;you shouldn't have said that&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I <i>am</i> making it hard! And I meant to&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&mdash;anyway, I think you'd better come. Unless it would be too hard for
      you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. Then Henry, his forehead wet with sweat, his
      feet braced apart, his hands gripping the rail as if he were holding for
      his life, said, with a sudden quiet that she found a little disconcerting:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. I'll come.... Your aunt said a quarter past six, didn't she?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, six.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      Madame Watt appropriated Henry the moment he entered her door on Saturday
      evening. She was, despite her talk of offhand summer informality, clad in
      an impressive costume with a great deal of lace and the shimmer of
      flowered silk.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her elbow, Henry moved through the crowd in the front hall. He felt
      cool eyes on him. He stood very straight and stiff. He was pale. He bowed
      to the various girls and fellows&mdash;Mary, Martha, Herb, Elbow, and the
      rest, with reserve. It was, from moment to moment, a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody but Madame Watt would have thought of giving such a party. It was
      so expensive&mdash;the dinner for twenty-two, to begin with; then all the
      railway fares; a bus from the station in Chicago to the theatre and back.
      The theatre tickets alone came to thirty-three dollars (these were the
      less expensive days of the dollar and a half seat). Sunbury still, at the
      time, was inclined to look doubtfully on ostentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      You felt, too, in the case of Madame, that she was likely to speak, at any
      moment rather&mdash;well, broadly. All that Paris experience, whatever it
      was, seemed to be hovering about the snapping black eyes and the
      indomitable mouth. You sensed in her none of the reserve of movement, of
      speech, of mind, that were implied in the feminine standards of Sunbury.
      Yet she was unquestionably a person. If she laughed louder than the ladies
      of Sunbury, she had more to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night she was a dominantly entertaining hostess. She talked of the
      theatre, in Paris, London and New York&mdash;of the Coquelins, Gallipaux,
      Bernhardt, of Irving and Terry and Willard and Grossmith. Some of these
      she had met. She knew Sothem, it appeared. Even the extremely worldly
      Elbow and Herb were impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had Henry at her right. Boldly placed him there. At his right was a
      girl from Omaha who was visiting the Smiths and who made several efforts
      to be pleasant to the pale gloomy youth with the little moustache and the
      distinctly interesting gray-blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they were settled on the train Henry found himself grateful to
      the certainly strong, however coarse-fibred woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Efforts to identify her as she seemed now, with the woman of that hideous
      scene with the Senator brought only bewilderment. He had to give it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This woman was rapidly winning his confidence; even, in a curious sense,
      his sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the farther end of the table the little Senator, all dignity and calm
      stilted sentences, made himself remotely agreeable to several girls at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one side of the table sat Cicely, in lacy white with a wonderful little
      gauzy scarf about her shoulders. She looked at him only now and then, and
      just as she looked at the others. He wondered how she could smile so
      brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herb and Elbow made a great joke of fighting over her. Elbow had her at
      dinner; Herb on the train; Elbow again at the theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was fairly clinging to Madame by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think, among the confused thoughts and feelings that whirled ceaselessly
      around and around in his brain, the one that came up oftenest and stayed
      longest was a sense of stoical heroism. For Cicely's sake he must bear his
      anguish. For her he must be humble, kindly, patient. He had read,
      somewhere in his scattered acquaintance with books, that Abraham Lincoln
      had once been brought to the point of suicide through a disappointment in
      love. And to-night he thought much and deeply of Lincoln. He had already
      decided, during an emotionally turbulent two days, not to shoot himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first intermission the Senator stayed quietly in his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the curtain went down for the second time, he stroked his beard with
      a small, none-too-steady hand, coughed in the suppressed way he had, and
      glanced once or twice at Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men were, apparently all of them, moving out for a smoke in the
      lobby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, with a tingling sense of defiance, a little selfconscious about
      staying alone with the girls, followed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after him, walking up the aisle with his odd strutting air of
      importance, came the Senator.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gathered the young men together in the lobby; pulled at his twisted
      beard; said, 'It will give me pleasure to offer you young gentlemen a
      little refreshment;' and led the way out to a convenient bar. It was a
      large, high-panelled room. There were great mirrors; rows and rows of
      bottles and shiny glasses; alcoves with tables; and enormous oil paintings
      in still more enormous gilt frames and lighted by special fixtures built
      out from the wall. The one over the bar exhibited an undraped female
      figure reclining on a couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood, a jolly group, naming their drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, who had no taste for liquor, stood apart, pale, sober, struggling
      to exhibit a <i>savoir faire</i> that had no existence in his mercurial
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll take ginger ale,' he said, in painful self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator, his somewhat jaunty straw hat thrust back a little way off
      his forehead, took Scotch; drank it neat. It seemed to Henry incongruous
      when the prim little man tossed the liquor back against his palate with a
      long-practised flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in his seat, between Madame and the girl from Omaha, Henry noted that
      the Senator had not returned with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame turned and looked up the aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights were dimmed. The curtain rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely was in the row ahead, Herb on one side, Elbow on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elbow was calm, casual, humorous in a way, whispering phrases that had
      been found amusing by many girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herb, the only man in what Henry still thought of as a 'full dress suit,'
      had a way of turning his head and studying Cicely's hair and profile
      whenever she turned toward Elbow, that stirred Henry to anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's rich,' thought Henry, twisting in his chair, clasping and unclasping
      his hands. 'He's rich. He can do everything for her. And he loves her. He
      couldn't look that way if he didn't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A comedian was singing and dancing on the stage. Cicely watched him, her
      eyes alight, her lips parted in a smile of sheer enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How can she!' he thought. 'How <i>can</i> she!' Then: 'I could do that.
      If I'd kept it up. If she'd seen me in <i>Iolanthe</i> maybe she'd care.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtain fell on a glittering finale.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a great chattering the party moved up the aisle. Cicely told her two
      escorts that she didn't know when she had enjoyed anything so much. She
      was merry about it. Care free as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stopped short in the foyer; standing aside, half behind a framed
      advertisement on an easel; his hands clenched in his coat pockets; white
      of face; biting his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can't go with them!' he was thinking. 'It's too much. I can't! I can't
      trust myself. I'd say something. But what'll they think?
    </p>
    <p>
      'She won't know. She won't care. She's happy&mdash;my suffering is nothing
      to her.' This was youthful bitterness, of course. But it met an immediate
      counter in the following thought, which, to any one who knew the often
      selfcentred Henry would have been interesting. 'But that's the way it
      ought to be. She mustn't know how I suffer. It isn't her fault. A great
      love just comes to you. Nobody can help it. It's tragedy, of course. Even
      if I have to&mdash;to'&mdash;his lip was quivering now&mdash;'to shoot
      myself, I must leave a note telling her she wasn't to blame. Just that I
      loved her too much to live without her. But I haven't any money. I
      couldn't make her happy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes, narrow points of fire, glanced this way and that. Almost
      furtively. Passion&mdash;a grown man's passion&mdash;was or seemed to him
      to be tearing him to pieces. And he hadn't a grown man's experience of
      life, the background of discipline and self-control, that might have
      helped him weather the storm. All he could do was to wonder if he had
      spoken aloud or only thought these words. He didn't know. Somebody might
      have heard. The crowd was still pouring slowly out past him. It seemed to
      him incredible that all the world shouldn't know about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others of the party were somewhere out on the street now. They were
      going to a restaurant; then, in their bus, to the twelve-fourteen, the
      last train for Sunbury until daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could he do if he didn't take that train? He might hide up forward,
      in the smoker. But there were a hundred chances that he would be seen. No,
      that wouldn't do. He must hurry after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he flatly couldn't. Why, the tears were coming to his eyes. A little
      weakness, whenever he was deeply moved, for which he despised himself.
      There was no telling what he might do&mdash;cry like a girl, break out
      into an impossible torrent of words. A scene. Anywhere; on the street, in
      the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, however awkward, whatever the cost, he couldn't rejoin them, he
      couldn't look at Cicely and Elbow and Herb and the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in his pocket. Not enough money, of course. He never had enough.
      He couldn't ever plan intelligently. Yet he was earning twelve dollars a
      week!... He had a dollar, and a little change. Perhaps it was enough. He
      could go to a cheap hotel. He had seen them advertised&mdash;fifty or
      seventy-five cents for the night. And then an early morning train for
      Sunbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would be worse off then than ever, of course. The people who had
      talked, would have fresh material. Running away from the party! They might
      say that he had got drunk. Though in a way he would welcome that. It was a
      sort of way out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd was nearly gone. They would be closing the doors soon. Then he
      would have to go&mdash;somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      A big woman was making her way inward against the human current. But
      Henry, though he saw her and knew in a dreamy way that it was Madame Watt,
      still couldn't, for the moment, find place for her in his madly surging
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed him; looked into the darkened theatre; came back; stood before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came this brief conversation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You haven't seen him, Henry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I haven't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm! Awkward&mdash;he took the pledge&mdash;he swore it&mdash;I am
      counting on you to help me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course. Anything!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Were you out with him between the acts?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;yes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Did he drink anything then?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. He took Scotch.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, he did?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes'm.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's all off, then. See here, Henry, will you look? The same place? Be
      very careful. People mustn't know. And I must count on you. There's nobody
      else. We'll manage it, somehow. We've got to keep him quiet and get him
      out home. I'll be at the restaurant. You can send word in to me&mdash;have
      a waiter say I'm wanted at the telephone. Do that. And...'
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be doubted if Henry heard more than half of this speech. She was
      still speaking when he shot out to the street, dodged back of the waiting
      groups by the kerb and disappeared among the night traffic of the street
      in the direction of a certain bar.
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Senator's cheeks and forehead and nose were shining redly above the
      little white beard, which, for itself, looked more than ever askew. The
      straw hat was far back on his head. He waved a limp hand toward the
      enormous, brightly lighted painting that hung over the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, a painfully set look on his face, sat opposite, across the alcove,
      leaned heavily on the table, and watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passion had gone out of him. He was wishing, in a state near despair,
      that he had listened more attentively to what Madame Watt had said.
      Something about getting word to her&mdash;at the restaurant. But how could
      he? If it had seemed disastrously difficult before, full of his own
      trouble, to face that merry party, it was now, with this really tragic
      problem on his hands, flatly impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there wasn't a soul in the world to help him. He must work it out
      alone. Even if he might get word to Madame, what could she do? She
      couldn't leave her party. And she couldn't bring this pitiable object in
      among those young people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry's lips pressed together. The world looked to him just now a savage
      wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Consider women, for instance!' The Senator's hand waved again toward the
      picture. It was surprising to Henry that he could speak with such
      distinctness. 'Consider women! They toil not, neither do they spin. Yet at
      the last, they bite like a serpent and sting like an adder.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry held his watch under the table; glanced down. It was five minutes
      past twelve. For nearly an hour he had been sitting there, helpless,
      beating his brain for schemes that wouldn't present themselves. The
      twelve-fourteen was as good as gone, of course. Though it had not for a
      minute been possible. He thought vaguely, occasionally, of a hotel. But
      stronger and more persistent was the feeling that he ought to get him out
      home if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Women...!' The Senator drooped in his chair. Then looked up; braced
      himself; shouted, 'Here, boy! A bit more of the same!' When the glass was
      before him he drank, brightened a little, and resumed. 'Woman, my boy, is
      th' root&mdash;No, I will go farther! I will state that woman is th' root
      'n' branch of all evil.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, with a muttered, 'Excuse me, Senator!' got out of the alcove and
      stepped outside the door. He stood on the door-step; took off his hat and
      pressed a hand to his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the street, near the side door of the hotel, stood an old-fashioned
      closed hack. The driver lay curled up across his seat, asleep. The horses
      stood with drooping heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry gazed intently at the dingy vehicle. Slowly his eyes narrowed. He
      looked again at his watch. Then he moved deliberately across the way and
      woke the cabman.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hey!' he cried, as the man fumblingly put on his hat and blinked up the
      street and down. 'Hey, you! What'll you take to drive to Sunbury?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sunbury? Oh, that's a long way. And it's pretty late at night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know all that! How much'll you take?'
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman pondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fifteen dollars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, say I, that's twice too much! Why&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fifteen dollars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;&mdash;-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fifteen dollars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry swallowed. He felt very daring. He had heard of fellows and girls
      missing the late train and driving out. But the amount usually mentioned
      was ten dollars. However...
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Drive across here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over the Senator, who was talking, still on the one topic, to a
      small picture just above Henry's empty seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We're going home now, Senator. You'd better come with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Going home? No, not there. Not there. Back to the Senate, yes. Tha's
      different. But not home. If you knew what I've&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry led him out. But first the Senator, with some difficulty in the
      managing, paid his check. Henry would have paid it, but hadn't nearly
      enough. It had never occurred to him that a single individual could spend
      so large a sum on himself within the space of less, considerably less,
      than three hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman and Henry together got him into the hack.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They are pop&mdash;popularly known as the weaker sex. All a ter'ble
      mistake, young man. They're stronger. Li'l do you dream how stronger&mdash;how
      great&mdash;how more stronger they are. Curious about words. At times one
      commands them with ease. Other times they elude one. Words are more tricky&mdash;few
      suspect&mdash;but women allure us only to destroy us. Women....'
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the cab rolled across the Rush Street Bridge on its long journey to
      the northward he was asleep.
    </p>
    <h3>
      7
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was half-past two in the morning when a hack drawn by weary horses on
      whose flanks the later glistened, drew up at the porte cochère of the old
      Dexter Smith place in Sunbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman lumbered down and opened the door. A youth, nervously wide
      awake, leaped out. Then followed this brief conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Help me carry him up, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd better pay me first. Fifteen dollars!
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll do that afterward.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll take it now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I tell you I'm going to get it&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You mean you haven't got it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not on me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, look here&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ssh! You'll wake the whole house up! You've simply got to wait until I
      get home. You needn't worry. I'm going to pay you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd better. Say, he'd ought to have it on him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We're not going into his pockets. Now you do as I tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they lifted him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry looked up at the door. Madame Watt, somebody, had left this outside
      light burning. Doubtless the thing to do was just to ring the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brushed the cabman aside. The Senator was such a little man, so
      pitifully slender and light! And Henry himself was supple and strong. He
      took the little old gentleman up in his arms and carried him up the steps.
      And once again in the course of this strange night his eyes filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But not for himself this time. Henry's gift of insight, while it was now
      and for many years to come would be fitful, erratic, coming and going with
      his intensely varied moods, was none the less a real, at times a great,
      gift. And I think he glimpsed now, through the queer confusing mists of
      thought, something of the grotesque tragedy that runs, like a red and
      black thread, through the fabric of many human lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator had been a famous man. Through nearly two decades, as even
      Henry dimly knew, he had stood out, a figure of continuous national
      importance. And now he was just&mdash;this. Here in Henry's arms; inert.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ring the bell, will you!' said Henry shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cabman moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a light step within. The lock turned. The door swung open, and
      Cicely stood there.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was wrapped about in a wonderful soft garment of blue. She was pale.
      And her hair was all down, rippling about her shoulders and (when she
      stepped quickly back out of the cabman's vision) down her back below the
      waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry carried his burden in, and she quickly closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Has anybody seen? Does anybody know?' she asked, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned back against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. Nobody. But you&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've been sitting up, watching. I was so afraid aunt might&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you know?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Know? Why&mdash;Tell me, do you think you can carry him to his room?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me? Oh, easy! Why he doesn't weigh much of anything. Just look!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then come. Quickly. Keep very quiet.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, painstakingly, he followed her up the stairs and along the upper
      hall to an open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait!' she whispered. 'I'll have to turn on the light.' He laid the limp
      figure on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, in the still night, the horses stirred and stamped. A voice&mdash;the
      cabman's&mdash;cried,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Whoa there, you! Whoa!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely turned with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, why can't he keep still!... You&mdash;you'd better go. I don't know
      why you're so kind. Those others would never&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please!&mdash;You <i>do</i> know!'
    </p>
    <p>
      This remark appeared to add to her distress. She made a quick little
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, I don't mean&mdash;not that I want you to&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not so loud! Quick! Please go!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it's so terribly hard for you. I can't bear&mdash;I can't bear to
      think of your having to&mdash;people just mustn't know about it, that's
      all! We've got to do something. She mustn't&mdash;You see, I love you,
      and....
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep dominating voice came from the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You had better go to your room, Cicely,' it said.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned like guilty children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely flushed, then quietly went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was a strange spectacle. She wore a quilted maroon robe, which she
      held clutched together at her throat. Most of the hair that was usually
      piled and coiled about her head had vanished; what little remained was
      surprisingly gray and was twisted up in front and over the ears in curl
      papers of the old-fashioned kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry lowered his gaze; it seemed indelicate to look at her. He discovered
      then that he was still wearing his hat, and took it off with a low, wholly
      nervous laugh that was as surprising to himself as it certainly was, for a
      moment, to Madame Watt, who surveyed him under knit brows before centring
      her attention on the unconscious figure on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We owe you a great deal,' she said then. 'It was awkward enough. But it
      might have been a disaster. You've saved us from that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, it was nothing,' murmured Henry, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Are you sure no one saw? You didn't take him to the station?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No. We drove straight out.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm! When you came did you ring our bell?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Me? Why, no. I was going to. But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She&mdash;your&mdash;Miss&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you mean Cicely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. She opened the door.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame frowned again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what on earth&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry interrupted, looking up at her now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll tell you. I know. I can see it. And somebody's got to tell you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame looked mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      'She couldn't bear to have you know. She was afraid you&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame raised her free hand. 'We won't go into that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we <i>must</i>. It was your temper she was&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'We wont&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You <i>must</i> listen! Can't you see the dread she lives under&mdash;the
      fear that you'll forget yourself and people will know! And can't you see
      what it drives&mdash;him&mdash;to? I heard him talk when he was telling
      his real thoughts. I know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know. And I know this town. They're very conservative. They watch
      new people. They're watching you. Like cats. And they'll gossip. I know
      that too. I've suffered from it. Things that aren't so. But what do they
      care? They'd spoil your whole life&mdash;like that!&mdash;and go to the
      Country Club early to get the best dances. Oh, I know, I tell you. You've
      got to be careful. It isn't what I say, but you've <i>got</i> to! Or
      they'll find out, and they won't stop till they've hounded you out of
      town, and driven him to&mdash;this&mdash;for good, and broken her&mdash;your
      niece's&mdash;heart.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire that had flamed from his eyes died down, leaving them like gray
      ashes. Confusion smote him. He shifted his feet; turned his hat round and
      round between his hands. What&mdash;<i>what</i>&mdash;had he been saying!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he heard her voice, saying only this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'In a way&mdash;in a way&mdash;you have a right.... God knows it won't....
      So much at stake.... Perhaps it had to be said.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he had better retreat. Emotions were rising, and he was
      gulping them down. He knew now that he couldn't speak again; not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was very good of you,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he rushed past her and down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey, when he awoke in the morning, remembered dimly his temperamental
      young partner, a dishevelled, rather wild figure, bending over him,
      shaking him and saying, 'Gimme fifteen dollars! I'll explain to-morrow.
      Gosh, but I'm a wreck! You've no idea!'
    </p>
    <p>
      And he remembered drawing to him the chair on which his clothes were piled
      and fumbling in various pockets for money.
    </p>
    <h3>
      8
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Henry awoke, at ten, he found himself alone in the rooms. The warm
      sunshine was streaming in, the university clock was booming out the hour.
      Then the mellow church bells set up their stately ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay for a time drowsily listening. Then the bells brought
      recollections. Madame Watt, and Cicely, and often the Senator attended the
      First Presbyterian Church. Right across the alley, facing on Filbert
      Avenue. By merely turning his head, Henry could see the rear gable of the
      chapel and the windows of the Sunday-school room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      His blue serge coat was spotted. From the table in that bar-room,
      doubtless. He found a bottle of ammonia and sponged. It was also in need
      of a pressing, but he could do nothing about that now. He had to go to
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      No other course was thinkable. If only to sit where he could catch a
      glimpse now and then of her profile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard a knock downstairs, but at first ignored it. No one would be
      coming here of a Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he went down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, on the step, immaculately dressed, rather weary looking with dark
      areas under red eyes, stood Senator Watt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How do you do,' said he, with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Won't you come in?' said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      They mounted the stairs. The Senator sat stiffly on a small chair. Henry
      took the piano stool.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I understand that you did me a very great service last night, Mr
      Calverly.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no,' Henry managed to say, in a mumbling voice, throwing out his
      hands. 'No, it wasn't really anything at all.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You will please tell me what it cost.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh&mdash;why&mdash;well, fifteen dollars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator counted out the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You have placed me greatly in your debt, Mr Calverly. I hope that I may
      some day repay you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no! You see...'
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence fell upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Senator rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Drink,' he remarked then, 'is an unmitigated evil. Never surrender to
      it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I really don't drink at all, Senator.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Good! Don't do it. Life is more complex than a young man of your age can
      perceive. At best it is a bitter struggle. Evil habits are a handicap.
      They aggravate every problem. Good day. We shall see you soon again at the
      house, I trust.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, moved, looked after him as he walked almost briskly away&mdash;an
      erect, precise little man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Henry went to church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herb de Casselles ushered him to a seat. He could just see Cicely. He
      thought she looked very sad. Yet she sang brightly in the hymns. And after
      the benediction when Herb and Elbow and Dex Smith crowded about her in the
      aisle, she smiled quite as usual, and made her quick, eager Frenchy
      gestures.
    </p>
    <p>
      He brushed his hand across his eyes Had he been living through a dream&mdash;a
      tragic sort of dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way, between pews, to a side door, and hurried out. He
      couldn't speak to a soul; not now. He walked blindly, very fast, down to
      Chestnut Avenue, over to Simpson Street, then up toward the stores and
      shops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey had a way of working at the office Sundays. He decided to go
      there. There was the matter of the fifteen dollars. And Humphrey would
      expect him for their usual Sunday dinner at Stanley's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was passing Stanley's now. Next came Donovan's drug store. Next beyond
      that, Swanson's flower shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      A carriage&mdash;a Victoria&mdash;rolled softly by on rubber tyres. Silver
      jingled on the harness of the two black horses. Two men in plum-coloured
      livery sat like wooden things on the box. On the rear seat were Madame
      Watt and Cicely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage drew up before Swanson's. Madame Watt got heavily out and
      went into the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely had turned. She was waving her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry found his vision suddenly blurred. Then he was standing by the
      carriage, and Cicely was speaking, leaning over close to him so that the
      men couldn't hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was dreadful the way I let you go! I didn't even say good-night. And
      all the time I wanted you to know....'
    </p>
    <p>
      He couldn't speak. He stared at her, lips compressed; temples pounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to be smiling faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We&mdash;we might say good-night now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought he shivered. Then he said huskily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;I've wanted to call you&mdash;to call you&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes?'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&mdash;Cicely.'.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. She whispered, 'I think I've wanted you to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He had rested a hand on the plum upholstery beside her. In some way it
      touched hers; clasped it; gripped it feverishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colour came rushing to his face. And to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, through a blinding mist, that there were tears in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Ci&mdash;Cicely, you don't, you can't mean&mdash;that you&mdash;too....'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please, Henry! Not here! Not now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      They glanced up the street; and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come this afternoon,' she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They'll be there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Come early. Two o'clock. We'll take a walk.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh&mdash;Cicely!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Their hands were locked together until Madame came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage rolled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry&mdash;it seemed to himself&mdash;reeled dizzily along Simpson Street
      to the stairway that you climbed to get to the <i>Gleaner</i> office.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all along this street of his struggles, his failures, his one or two
      successes, his dreams, the dingy, two-story buildings laughed and danced
      and cheered about him, with him, for him&mdash;Hemple's meat-market,
      Berger's grocery, Swanson's, Donovan's, Schultz and Schwartz's barber
      shop, Stanley's, the Sunbury National Bank, the postoffice&mdash;all
      reeled jubilantly with him in the ecstasy of young love!

      THE SUNBURY WEEKLY GLEANER
    </h3>
    <p>
      By Weaver and Calverly
    </p>
    <p>
      'How late you going to stay, Hump?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey raised his eyes, listlessly thrust his pencil back of his ear,
      and looked rather thoughtfully at the youth in the doorway; a dapper
      youth, in an obviously new 'Fedora' hat, a conspicuous cord of black silk
      hanging from his glasses, his little bamboo cane, caught by its crook in
      the angle of his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's gaze wandered to the window; settled on the roof of the Sunbury
      National Bank opposite. He suppressed a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I may want to talk with you, Hen. I've been figuring&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth in the doorway shifted his position with a touch of impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      'See here, Hump, you know I can't make head or tail out of figures!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey looked down at the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Anyway I'll see you at supper,' Henry added defensively.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mildred expects me down there for supper,' said Humphrey. The sigh came
      now. He pushed up the eyeshade and slowly rubbed his eyes. 'But I may not
      be able to get away. There are times, Hen, when you have to look figures
      in the face.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth flushed at this, and replied, rather explosively;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'A fellow has to do the sorta thing he <i>can</i> do, Hump!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;will you be at the rooms this evening?' Humphrey's eyes were
      again taking in the natty costume. And surveying him, Humphrey answered
      his own question; dryly. 'I imagine not.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;I was going over to the Watts.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence:
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Henry let himself slowly out and closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, on the landing, he paused again; but this time to button his coat
      and pull up the blue-bordered handkerchief in his breast pocket until a
      corner showed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked too, by the fading light&mdash;it was mid-September, and the sun
      would be setting shortly, out over the prairie&mdash;at the tin legend on
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight seemed to reassure him somewhat. As did the other, similar tin
      legends that were tacked up between the treads of the long flight of
      stairs that led to Simpson Street, at each of which he turned to look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey had before him a pile of canvas-bound account books, a spindle of
      unpaid bills, a little heap of business letters, and a pad covered with
      pencilled columns. He rested an elbow among the papers, turned his chair,
      and looked through the window down into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment passed, then he saw Henry walking diagonally across toward
      Donovan's drug store.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an ice-cream soda, of course; or one of those thick, 'frosted' fluids
      of chocolate or coffee flavour that he affected. And it was now within an
      hour of supper time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey leaned forward. Yes, there he stood, on the kerb before
      Donovan's, looking, with a quick nervous jerking of the head, now up
      Simpson Street, now down. Yes, that was his hurry&mdash;the usual thing.
      Madame Watt made a point of driving down to meet the five-twenty-nine from
      town. Senator Watt always came out then. And usually Cicely Hamlin came
      along with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey sighed, rose, stood looking down at the bills and letters and
      canvas books; pressed a hand again against his eyes; wandered to the
      press-room door and looked, pursing his lips, knitting his brows, at the
      row of job presses, at the big cylinder press that extended nearly across
      the rear end of the long room, at the row of type cases on their high
      stands, at imposing-stones on heavy tables. He sniffed the odour of ink,
      damp paper, and long, respected dust that hung over the whole
      establishment. He smiled, moodily, as his eye rested on the gray and black
      roller towel that hung above the iron sink, recalling Bob Burdette's
      verses. He returned to the office, and stood for a few moments before the
      file of the <i>Gleaner</i> on the wall desk by the door, turning the pages
      of recent issues. From each number a story by Henry Calverly, 3rd, seemed
      to leap out at his eyes and his brain. <i>The Caliph of Simpson Street,
      Sinbad the Treasurer, A Kerbstone Barmecide, The Cauliflowers of the
      Caliph, The Printer and the Pearls, Ali Anderson and the Four Policemen</i>&mdash;the
      very titles singing aloud of the boy's extraordinary gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And it's all we've got here,' mused Humphrey, moving back to his own
      desk. 'That mad child makes us, or we break. I've got to humour him,
      protect him. Can't even show him these bills. Like getting all your light
      and heat from a candle that may get blown out any minute.' And before
      dropping heavily into his chair, glancing at his watch, drawing his
      eye-shade down, and plunging again at the heavy problem of keeping a
      country weekly alive without sufficient advertising revenue, he added,
      aloud, with a wry, wrinkly smile that yet gave him a momentary whimsical
      attractiveness: 'That's the devil of it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a step on' the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened slowly. A red face appeared, under a tipped-down Derby
      hat; a face decorated with a bristling red moustache and a richly carmine
      nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey peered; then considered. It was Tim Niernan, one-time fire chief,
      now village constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Young Calverly here?' asked the official in a husky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey shook his head. His thoughts, momentarily disarranged, were
      darting this way and that.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it, Tim? What do you want of him?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim seemed embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;&mdash;' he began, 'why&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Some trouble?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, you see Charlie Waterhouse's suing him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey tried to consider this.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What for?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;libel. One o' them stories o' his. I liked 'em myself. My
      folks all say he's a great kid. But Charlie's pretty sore.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Suing for a lot, I suppose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why yes. Well&mdash;ten thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hm!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He lives with you, don't he&mdash;back of the Parmenter place?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes.' Humphrey's answer was short. At the moment he was not inclined to
      make Tim's task easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable went out. Humphrey watched him from the window. He passed
      Donovan's on the other side of the street and kept on toward the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey returned to the wall file, and, standing there, read <i>Sinbad
      the Treasurer</i> through.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an extraordinarily fresh, naive power in the story. Simpson
      Street was mentioned by name. There was but the one town treasurer,
      whether you called him 'Sinbad' or Waterhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He certainly did cut loose,' mused Humphrey. 'Charlie's got a case. Got
      his nerve, too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he dropped into his chair and sat, for a long time, very quiet,
      tapping out little tunes on his hollowed cheek with a pencil.
    </p>
    <h3>
      2
    </h3>
    <p>
      Henry turned away from Donovan's soda fountain, wiping froth from his
      moustache, and sauntered to the nearer of the two doors. His brows were
      knit in a slight frown that suggested anxiety. There was earnestness,
      intensity, in the usually pleasant gray-blue eyes as he peered now up the
      street, now down.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low-hung Victoria, drawn by a glossy team in harness that glittered with
      silver, swung at a dignified pace around the corner of Filbert Avenue, two
      wooden men in plum-coloured livery on the box, two dignified figures on
      the rear seat, one middle-aged, large, formidable, commanding, sitting
      erect and high, the other slighter and not commanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, at the sight, Henry's frown gave place to a nervously eager
      smile, returned, went again. When the carriage at length drew up before
      Berger's grocery, across the way, however, he had both frown and smile
      under reasonable control and was a presentable if deadly serious young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman leaped down and stood at attention. The formidable one stepped
      out and entered Berger's. And the slight, fresh-faced girl, leaned out to
      welcome the youth who rushed across the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sunbury, in the nineties, a youth and a maiden could 'go together'
      without a thought of the future. The phrase implied frank pairing off,
      perhaps an occasionally shyly restrained sentimental passage, in general a
      monopoly of the other's spare time. An 'understanding,' on the other hand,
      was a. distinctly transitive state, leading to engagement and marriage as
      soon as the youth was old enough or could earn a living or the opposition
      of parents could be overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relationship between Cicely and Henry had lately hovered delicately
      between the two states. If it seemed, after each timid advance, to recede
      from the 'understanding' point; that was because of the burdens and the
      heavy responsibility that instantly claimed their thoughts at the mere
      suggestion of engagement and marriage:
    </p>
    <p>
      There were among the parents of Henry's boyhood friends, couples that had
      married at twenty or even younger, and on no greater income than Henry's
      rather doubtful twelve dollars a week. But that day had gone by. An
      'understanding' meant now, at the very least, that you were saving for a
      diamond. You could hardly ask a nice girl to become engaged without one.
    </p>
    <p>
      And marriage meant good clothes for parties, receptions and Sundays, and
      the street; it meant membership in the Country Club, a reasonably priced
      pew in church, a rented house, at least, preferably not in South Sunbury
      and distinctly not out on the prairie or too near the tracks, a certain
      amount invested in furniture, dishes and other house fittings, and
      reasonable credit with the grocer and at the meat-market. You could hardly
      ask a nice girl to go in for less than that. You really couldn't afford to
      let her go in for less.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they were marrying later now; six or eight or ten years later. And the
      girls were turning to older men. Here in Sunbury, Clemency Snow had
      married a man seven or eight years older whose younger brother had been
      among her playmates. Jane Bellman had married a shy little doctor of
      thirty-one or two. And Martha Caldwell, whom Henry had 'gone with' for two
      or three years, was permitting the rich, really old bachelor, James B.
      Merchant, Jr., to devote about all his time to her. He was thirty-eight if
      a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a disturbing condition for the town boys. Thoughts of it cast black
      shadows on Henry's undisciplined brain as he looked at the girl in the
      Victoria, felt, in the very air about them, her quick, bright smile, the
      delicately responsive liftings of her eyebrows, her marked desirability.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Henry,' she was saying, 'I've just been hearing the most wonderful
      things about you! You can't imagine! At Mrs MacLouden's tea. There was a
      man there&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry sniffed. A man at a tea! And talking to Cicely! Making up to her,
      doubtless.
    </p>
    <p>
      '&mdash;a friend of Mr Merchant's, from New York. And what do you think?
      Mr Merchant showed him your stories. The ones that have come out. He's
      been keeping them. Isn't that remarkable? They read them aloud. And this
      man says that you are more promising than Richard Harding Davis was at
      your age. Henry&mdash;just <i>think!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Henry was scowling. He was thinking with hot, growing concern, of the
      man. A rich old fellow, of course! One of the dangerous ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned over the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cicely&mdash;you&mdash;you're expecting me to-night?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh! Why yes, Henry, of course I'd like to have you come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But weren't you <i>expecting</i> me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;yes, Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course'&mdash;stiffly&mdash;'if you'd rather I wouldn't come...'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Please, Henry! You mustn't. Not here on the street!' He stood, flushing
      darkly, swallowing down the emotion that threatened to choke him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know I want you to come.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This was unsatisfactory. Indeed he hardly heard it. He was full of his
      thoughts about her, about the older men, about those tremendous burdens
      that he couldn't even pretend to assume. And then came a mad recklessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Cicely&mdash;this is awful&mdash;I just can't stand it! Why can't we
      have an understanding? Call it that? Stop all this uncertainty! I&mdash;I&mdash;I've
      just got to speak to your aunt&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry! Please! Don't say those things&mdash;-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's it! You won't let me say them.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not here&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, please, Cicely! Please! I know I'm not earning much; but I'll be
      twenty-one on the seventh of November and then I'll have more'n three
      thousand dollars. Please let me tell her that, Cicely. Oh, I know it
      wouldn't do to spend all the principal,&mdash;but it would go a long way
      toward setting us up&mdash;you know&mdash;' his voice trembled, dropped
      even lower, as with awe&mdash;'get the things we'd need when we were&mdash;you
      know&mdash;well, married.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt, as he poured out this mumbled torrent of words, that he was
      rushing to a painful failure. Cicely had drawn back. She looked
      bewildered, and tired. And he had fetched up in a black maze of despairing
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The footman must have heard part of it. He was standing very straight. And
      the coachman was staring out over the horses. He had probably heard too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Madame Watt came sailing out Of Berger's; fixed her hawk eyes on him
      with a curious interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he lifted his hat. He saw, or half saw, that Cicely tried to
      smile. She did bob her head in the bright quick way she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Victoria rolled away, and he was standing, one foot in the
      street, the other on the kerb, gazing after them through a mist of
      something so near tears that he was reduced to a painful struggle to gain
      even the appearance of self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, for a quarter-hour, mood followed mood so fast that they almost
      maddened him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought of old Hump, up there in the office, fighting out their common
      battle. Perhaps he ought to go back; do his best to understand the
      accounts. Figures always depressed him. No matter. He would go back. He
      would show Hump that he could at least be a friend. Yes, he could at least
      show that. Thing to do was to keep thinking of the other fellow. Forget
      yourself. That was the thing!
    </p>
    <p>
      But what he did, first, was to cross over to Swanson's flower shop and
      sternly order violets. Paid cash for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Miss Cicely Hamlin?' asked the Swanson-girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes,' growled Henry, 'for Miss Hamlin. Send them right over, please.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he walked around the block; muttering aloud; starting;
      glancing-about; muttering again. He could hardly go to Cicely's. Not this
      evening! Not when she had been willing to leave it like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to go, of course. Too early. By seven-thirty or so. But he told
      himself he wouldn't do it. She would have to write him. Or lose him. He
      would wait in dignified silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The early September twilight was settling down on Sunbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lights came on, here and there. The dusk was a relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had wrecked everything. It wasn't so much that he had proposed an
      understanding. In the circumstances she couldn't altogether object to
      that. It was risking the vital, final decision, of course. But that,
      sooner or later, would have to be risked. That was something a man had to
      face, and go through, and be a sport about. No, the trouble seemed to be
      that he had lost himself. He had made it awkward, impossible, for both of
      them. Through his impatience he had created an impossible situation. And
      in losing himself he had lost her, and lost her in the worst way
      imaginable. He had contrived to make an utterly ridiculous figure of
      himself, and, in a measure, of her. He had to set his teeth hard on that
      thought, and compress his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on Simpson Street again. Yellow gas-light shone out of the windows
      of the <i>Gleaner</i> offices, over Hemple's. Old Hump was hard at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went up there.
    </p>
    <h3>
      3
    </h3>
    <p>
      Humphrey was sitting there, chin on chest, long legs stretched under the
      desk. He didn't look up; only a slight start and a movement of one hand
      indicated that he heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood, confused, a thought alarmed, looking at him; moved aimlessly
      to his own desk and stirred papers about; came, finally, and sat on a
      corner of the exchange table, tapping his cane nervously against his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Aren't going to stay here all night, are you, Hump?' he asked, rather
      huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey's hand moved again; he didn't speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump! What's the matter? Anything happened?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But you know we're picking up in advertising, Hump?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not near enough.' This was a non-committal growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And see the way our circulation's been&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Losing money on it. Can't carry it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;but, Hump&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      The senior partner waved his hand. His face was gray and grim, his voice
      restrained. He even smiled as he deliberately filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's bad, Hen. Very, very bad. I've tried to keep you from worrying, but
      you've got to know now. We paid a little over two thousand for this plant
      and the good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cheap enough, wasn't it?' cried Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'If we'd really got her for that, yes. But look at the capital it takes.
      Building up. I had just a thousand more, a bond. Threw that in last month,
      you know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh'&mdash;breathed Henry, fright in his eyes&mdash;'I forgot about that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you can't raise a cent.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry tried to think this over. He started to speak; swallowed; slipped
      off the table; stood there; lifted his cane and sighted along it out the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I can&mdash;November seventh,' he finally remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey blew a smoke-ring; followed it with his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'My boy, nations, worlds, constellations, may crash between now and
      November seventh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;I could tackle my uncle again,' murmured Henry, out of a
      despairing face.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was at times an acid quality in Humphrey. Henry felt it in him now,
      as he said dryly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'As I recall your last transaction with your uncle, Hen, he told you
      finally that you couldn't have one cent of your principal before November
      seventh.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He&mdash;well, yes, he did say that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Meant it, didn't he?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Y&mdash;yes. He meant it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He's a business man, I believe.' Humphrey smoked for a moment; then
      added, with that same biting quality in his voice, 'And unless he's insane
      he would hardly put money into this business now. As it stands&mdash;or
      doesn't stand. And I presume he's not insane. No, we'll drop that
      subject.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry felt Humphrey's eyes on him. Sombre cold eyes. And he fell again, in
      his misery, to sighting along his cane. It seemed to Henry that the world
      was reeling to disaster. His young, over keen imagination was painting
      ugly, inescapable pictures of a savage world in which all effort seemed to
      fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Humphrey and himself a gulf had opened. It was growing wider every
      minute. Nothing he could say would help; words were no good. He was afraid
      he might try to talk. It would be like him; floods of talk, meaningless,
      mere words, really mere nerves. He clamped his lips on that fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I understand Henry, the thing that had brought him to despair&mdash;and
      he was in despair&mdash;was neither the sorry condition of the business,
      nor the trouble with Cicely. These had confused and saddened him. But the
      hopelessness had come after he saw Humphrey's face and eyes and caught
      that cool note in his voice. To the day of his death Henry couldn't endure
      hostility in those close about him. He had to have friendly sympathy, an
      easy give and take of the spirit in which his <i>naïveté</i> would not be
      misunderstood. This sort of atmosphere provided, apparently, the only soil
      in which his faculties could take root and grow. Hostility in those he had
      been led to trust disarmed him, crushed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump,' he ventured now, weakly, 'I think&mdash;maybe&mdash;you'd better
      show me those figures. I&mdash;I'll try to understand 'em. I will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey gave a little snort; brushed the idea away with a sweep of a long
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No use!' he said brusquely. He rolled down the desktop and locked it with
      a snap. 'Getting stale myself. Sleep on it. Not a thing you can do, Hen!'
      He knocked the ashes from his pipe, gloomily. Buttoned his vest. Suddenly
      he broke out with this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'You're a lucky brute, Hen!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry started; glanced up; fumbled at his moustache. 'You're wondering why
      I said that. But, man, you're a genius&mdash;Yes, you are! I have to plug
      for it. But you've got the flare. You know well enough what's loaded all
      this circulation on us. Your stories! Not a thing else. You'll do more of
      'em. You'll be famous.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, Hump I You don't know how I've&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you'll be famous. I won't. It's a gift&mdash;fame, success. It's a
      sort of edge God&mdash;or something&mdash;puts on a man. A cutting edge.
      You've simply got it. I simply haven't.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry pulled and pulled at his moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you've got a girl&mdash;a lovely girl. She's mad about you&mdash;oh,
      yes she is! I know. I've seen her look at you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Hump, you don't just know what&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'She doesn't have to hide her feelings. Not seriously, not with a lying
      smile. And you don't have to hide yours. You haven't got this furtive rope
      around your neck, strangling the breath of decent morality out of your
      soul. Thank God you don't know what it means&mdash;that struggle. She'll
      be announcing her engagement one of these days.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There'll be presents and flowers. You'll get stirred up and write
      something a thousand times better than you know how to write. Money will
      come&mdash;oh, yes it will! It'll roll to you, Hen. For a time. Or at
      times. And you'll marry&mdash;a nice clean wedding. God, just to think of
      it is like the May winds off the lake!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw out his long arms. Henry thought, perversely enough, that he
      looked like Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But the greatest thing of all is that you're twenty. Think of it!
      Twenty!... Hen, when I was twenty I put my life on a schedule for five
      years. They were up last month.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was to be flying at twenty-four. Think of it&mdash;flying! Through the
      air, man! Like a gull! At twenty-five I was to be famous and rich. A
      conqueror! I slaved for that. Worked days and nights and Sundays for that.
      Sweated for the Old Man there on the <i>Voice</i>; put up with his stupid
      little insults.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang up; got into his coat; looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm late. Got to stop at the rooms too. Mildred'll be wondering. You can
      stay here if you like.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But Henry clung to him. Around the back street they went. And Humphrey
      talked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'm twenty-five! And where've I got? I love a woman. Hen, I hope
      you'll never be torn as I'm torn now. You think you've been through
      things. Why, you're an innocent babe. I've got a woman's name&mdash;and
      that's a woman's life, Hen!&mdash;in my hands. It's a muddle. Maybe
      there's tragedy in it. May never work out. Sometimes I feel as if we were
      going straight over a precipice, she and I. It goes dark. It suffocates
      me.... It's costing me everything. It'll take money&mdash;a lot of it&mdash;money
      I haven't got. If the paper goes, my last hopes go with it. If we can't
      turn that corner. Everything comes down bang. No use.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry tried to say, 'Oh, I guess we'll turn our corner all right;' but if
      the words passed his lips at all it was only as a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a hundred feet from the alley back of Parmenter's. It was dark
      now, there in the shade of the double row of maples. Humphrey stopped
      short; pressed his hands to his eyes; then looked at Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You coming to the rooms, too?' he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't know's I&mdash;I was forgetting, so many things&mdash;Oh well,
      come along. It hardly matters.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At the alley entrance a man intercepted them; said, 'This is Henry
      Calverly, ain't it?' Struck a match and read an extraordinary mumble of
      words. He struck other matches, and read hurriedly on. Then he moved
      apologetically away, leaving Henry backed limply against a board fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey stood waiting, a tall shadow of a man. To him Henry turned,
      feeling curiously weak in the legs and gone at the stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What is it?' he asked, weakly, meekly. 'I couldn't understand. Did he ar&mdash;arrest
      me or something?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Charlie Waterhouse has sued you for libel. Ten thousand dollars. Come on.
      I can't wait.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;but&mdash;but that's foolish. He can't&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's how it is.' Humphrey was grim.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked in silence up the alley. Henry stood by while his partner
      unlocked the neat front door to the old barn, a white door, with one white
      step and an iron scraper. He could just make them out in the dusk. He
      wondered if he mightn't presently wake up and find it a dream.... Old
      Hump!
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood in the shop. Humphrey had switched on one light; he looked now,
      his face deeply seamed, his eyes a little sunken, at the dim shadowy metal
      lathes, the huge reels of copper wire, the tool benches, the rows of wall
      boxes filled with machine parts, the small electric motors hanging by
      twisted strings or wires from the ceiling joists, the heavy steel wheels
      in frames, the great box kites and the spruce and silk planes, in
      sections, the gas engine, the water motor, the wheels, shafts, and belting
      overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his sombre eyes on Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      That youth, aching at heart, bruised of spirit, unaware of the figure he
      made, was too far gone to be further puzzled by the weary, mocking smile
      that flitted across Humphrey's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump!' he cried out: 'What'll we do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do? Sleep over it. Raise some more money?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But how?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey waved a hand at the machinery. 'All this. And my library
      upstairs. They've stood me more'n four thousand, altogether. Ought to
      fetch something.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But&mdash;but&mdash;ten thousand!' Henry whispered the amount with awe as
      well as misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, <i>that!</i> Your trouble! Why, you'll sleep over that, too, and
      to-morrow I suppose you'll talk to Harry Davis's father.' The senior
      Davis, Arthur P., was a Simpson Street lawyer. 'They'll sting you. But
      they don't expect any ten thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what I said is <i>true!</i> Charlie Waterhouse is a&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's that got to do with it. You can't prove it. And we aren't strong
      enough to hire counsel and detectives and run him to earth. Doesn't look
      as if we had the barest breath of life in us. Charlie'll think of your
      uncle next, and attach your mother's estate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this with unusual roughness. Then he went upstairs; stamped around
      for a brief time; came hurrying down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, now, was sitting dejectedly on a work-bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump&mdash;please!&mdash;you don't know how I feel. I&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And,' replied the senior partner, 'I don't care. I don't care how I feel,
      either. We either save the paper this week or we don't. That's what I care
      about right now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;I won't let you sell your things, Hump.' An unconvincing
      assertion, from the limp figure on the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You?' Humphrey stared at him with something near contempt&mdash;stared at
      the moustache and the cane. 'You? You won't let me?... For God's sake, <i>shut
      up!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      With which he went out, slamming the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time Henry continued to sit there. Then he dragged himself upstairs,
      went to his bookcase and got the book entitled <i>Will Power and Self
      Mastery</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned the pages until he hit upon these paragraphs:&mdash;'Every
      machine, every cathedral, every great ship was a thought before it could
      become a fact. Build in your brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Through the all-enveloping ether drifts the invisible electricity that is
      all life, all energy. Open yourself to it. Make yourself a conductor.
      Stupidity and fear are resistants; cast these out. Make your brain a
      dynamo and drive the world.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed a good idea.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      Arthur P. Davis was just rising from the supper table when the door-bell
      rang. He answered it himself; found young Calverly there, in a state of
      haggard but vigorous youthful intensity. He contrived, after a slight
      initial difficulty, to draw out of the curiously verbose youth the
      essential facts. He considered the matter with a deliberation and caution
      that appeared irritating to the boy. But he had read and (in the bosom of
      his family) chuckled over <i>Sinbad the Treasurer</i>. He had wondered a
      little, though he didn't mention the fact to Henry, whether Charlie
      wouldn't sue. Charlie had a case.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Henry left, clearly still in a confused condition, it was Mr Davis's
      impression that Henry had placed the matter in his hands as counsel and
      further had distinctly agreed to shut his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry apparently understood it differently. Or, more likely, he didn't
      understand at all. Henry was, at the moment, a storm centre with
      considerable emotional disturbance still to come. Any one who has followed
      Henry, who knows him at all, will understand that such disturbance within
      him led directly and always to action. Whatever he may have said to Mr
      Davis, he was helpless. He had to function in his own way. Probably Mr
      Davis's use in the situation was to stimulate Henry's already overactive
      brain. Hardly more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly it was hardly later than a quarter or twenty minutes past seven
      when Henry appeared at Charlie Waterhouse's place on Douglass Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town treasurer was on the lawn, shifting his sprinkler by the light of
      the arc lamp on the corner and smoking his after-supper cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation took place across the picket fence, one of the few
      surviving in Sunbury at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry said, fiercely:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want to talk to you about that libel suit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't talk to me, Henry. You'll have to see my lawyer.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yay-ah, I know. I've got a lawyer too.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right. Let 'em talk to each other.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You know you can't get any ten thousand dollars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't talk about that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you can. You gotta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, I've gotta, have I?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you bet you have. Some people seem to think you've got a case.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Guess there ain't much doubt about that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Mebbe there ain't. Even if what I said was true.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here, Henry, I don't care to have this kind o' talk going on around
      here. You better go along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Go along nothing! I'll say every word of it. And what's more, you'll
      listen. No, don't you go. You stand right there.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlie, a stoutish man in an alpaca coat, with a florid countenance and a
      huge moustache, gave a moment's consideration to the blazing young
      crusader before him. The boy wasn't going to be any too easy to handle. He
      had no need to see him clearly to become aware of that fact. Charlie
      shifted his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lemme put it this way. S'pose you could sting me. You'd never get ten
      thousand. But s'pose, after I get through talking, you decide to go ahead
      and push the case&mdash;&mdash;-'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Push the case? Well, rather!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait a minute! All right, let's say you're going ahead and fight for part
      o' that ten thousand. What you think you could get. Then what'm I going to
      do?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Do you suppose I care what&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes you do! Now listen! I want you to get this straight. You&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>You</i> want <i>me</i> to&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Keep still! Now here's&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look here, I won't have you&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, you will! Listen. If you fight, I'll fight. I'll go straight after
      you. I'll run you to earth. I'll hire detectives to shadow you. I <i>know</i>
      you ain't straight, and I'll show you up before the whole dam town. I'm
      right and I tell you right here I'm going to <i>prove</i> it! I'll put you
      in prison! I'll&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      During most of this speech Charlie was talking too. But in so low a tone
      that he could hardly miss what Henry was saving. He broke in now with a
      loud:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Shut up!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stopped really because he was out of breath. It gratified him to see
      that neighbours were appearing in their lighted windows. And a youthful
      chorus on a porch across the way was suddenly hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Came here to make a scene, did you? Well, I'll&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I didn't come here to make a scene. I came here to make you listen to
      reason and I'm going to do it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, drop your voice a little, can't you! No sense in yelling our
      private affairs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure I'll drop my voice. You're the one that started the yelling.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I don't say you couldn't make it hard for any man in my position if
      you want to be nasty&mdash;fight that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You wait!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what I'd like to know is&mdash;what I'd like to know... Where you
      goin' to get the money to hire all those detectives?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Where'm I going to get the money to pay you if you win the suit?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Charlie came back with, 'Oh, I'll win the suit all right, all
      right!' this was clearly a facer. He added, pondering, 'I guess Munson'll
      manage to attach anything you've got.' But he was at sea. 'Fine dirty idea
      o' yours, hounding a decent man, with detectives.' And finally, 'Well,
      what do you want?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Listen! S'pose you did win. You'd never get ten thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd get five.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, you wouldn't. Why don't you act sensible and tell me what you'll take
      to stop it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd have to think that over.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You tell me now or I'll bust this town open.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No good talking that way, Henry. Can you get any money?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Tell you for sure in twenty-four hours.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But it ain't the money. You've assailed my character. That's what you've
      done. Will you retract in print?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I won't. But if you'll come down to a decent price and promise to
      call off the boycott&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What boycott?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Advertising. You know. You do that, and I'll agree to leave you alone.
      Somebody else'll have to find you out, that's all. I've gotta help Hump
      Weaver pull the <i>Gleaner</i> out. I guess that's my job now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this last sadly. He had read stories of wonderful young St Georges
      who slew a dozen political dragons at a time. Who never compromised or
      gave hostages to fortune. But there was only one chance for the paper and
      for old Hump. That chance was here and now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sorry he couldn't see Charlie Waterhouse's face. 'What'll you
      give?' asked that worthy, after thoughtfully chewing, his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lord, no. Four thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's impossible.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Three, then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, I won't pay anything like three.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wouldn't go a cent under two.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;two thousand then. All right. I'll let you know by to-morrow
      night.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You understand, Henry, it ain't the money. It's for the good o' the town
      I'm doing it. To keep peace, y' understand. That's why I'm doing it. Y'
      understand that, Henry.' He actually reached over the fence and hung to
      the boy's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We'd better shake hands on it,' said Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure! I'll stand by it, if you will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I will. Good-bye, now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Henry, somewhat confused regarding his ethical position, depressed at
      the thought that you couldn't rise altogether out of this hard world, that
      you had to live right in it, compromise with it, let yourself be soiled by
      it&mdash;Henry, his eyes down to beads, flushed about the temples, caught
      the eight-six to Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode out to the West Side on a cable-car. It is an interesting item to
      note in the rather zig-zag development of Henry's highly emotional nature
      that he never once weakened during that long ride. He was burning up, of
      course. It was like that wonderful week when he had written day and night,
      night and day, the Simpson Street stories. But it was, in a way, glorious.
      That ethereal electricity was flowing right through him. The Power was on
      him. He knew, not in his surface mind but in the deeper seat of all
      belief, in his feelings, that he couldn't be stopped or headed. Not
      to-night.
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      'You are not altogether clear, Henry. Let me understand this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene was Uncle Arthur's 'den.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had run the gauntlet of his cousins. Rich young cousins, brought up
      to respect their parents and think themselves poor. It was a proper home,
      with order, cleanliness, method shining out. He resented it. He resented
      them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur was thin, and penetrating. His eyes bored at you. His nose
      was sharp, his brow furrowed. It seemed to Henry that he was always
      scowling a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      His light sharp voice was going on, stating a disentangled, re-arranged
      version of Henry's extraordinary outbursts:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'This man, the town treasurer, is suing you for libel, and you are advised
      that he has a case? But he will settle for two thousand dollars?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. He will.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you have come to me with the idea that I will pay over your mother's
      money for the purpose?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll be twenty-one anyway in less'n two months. But that ain't&mdash;isn't&mdash;it
      exactly, not all of it. I've really got to have the whole three thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, you have?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. It's like this. We bought the <i>Gleaner</i>, Hump Weaver and I. And
      we got it cheap, too. Two thousand&mdash;for plant, good will, the big
      press, everything.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hmm!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then I wrote those stories. They jumped our circulation way up. More'n we
      can afford. Queer about that. Because the paper'd been attacking Charlie
      Waterhouse, they got the advertiser's to boycott us.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now Charlie's promised me, if I pay him, to call off the boycott. It'll
      give us all the Simpson Street advertising. And Hump says we'll fail in a
      week if we don't get it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry!' Uncle Arthur's voice rang out with unpleasant clarity. 'You got
      from me a thousand dollars of your mother's estate. You sank it in this
      paper. I let you have that thinking it would bring you to your senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has not brought you to your senses. That is evident.... Now I am going
      to tell you something extremely serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      I tell you this because I believe that you are not, for one thing,
      dishonest. I have discovered that when I gave you that sum and took your
      receipt I was not protected. You are a minor. You cannot, in law, release
      me from my obligation as your guardian. After you have come of age you
      could collect it again from me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, Uncle Arthur, I wouldn't do <i>that!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I am sure you wouldn't. But you can readily see, now, that it is utterly
      impossible for me to make any further advances to you. Even if I were
      willing. And I am distinctly not willing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But listen, Uncle Arthur! You've got to!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The scowl of this narrow-faced man deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I don't care for impudence, Henry. We will not talk further about this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we must, Uncle Arthur! Don't you see, I've got to pay Charlie, and
      have Mr Davis get his receipt and the papers signed before they learn
      about you, or they'll attach the estate. Why, Charlie might get all of it,
      and more too. They might just wreck me. I mustn't lose a minute.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur sat straight up at this. Henry thought he looked even more
      deeply annoyed. But he spoke, after a long moment, quite calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'You are right there. That is a point. Putting it aside for a moment, what
      were you proposing to do with the other thousand dollars?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry felt the sharp eyes focusing on him. He sprang up. His words came
      hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Because Hump has put in a thousand more'n I have now. He said to-night
      he'd have to sell his library and his&mdash;his own things. I can't let
      him do that. I <i>won't</i> let him. I've got to stand with him.' Henry
      choked up a little now.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Hump's my friend, Uncle Arthur. He's steady and honest and&mdash;&mdash;'
      He faltered momentarily; Uncle Arthur was peculiarly the sort of person
      you couldn't tell about Humphrey's love affair; he wouldn't be able then
      to see his strong points.... 'He edits the paper and gets the pay-roll and
      goes out after the ads. And he <i>hates</i> it! But he's a wonderful
      fighter. I won't desert him. I won't! I can't!... Uncle Arthur, why won't
      you come out and see our place and meet Hump and let him show you our
      books and how our circulation's jumped and...'
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice trailed off because Uncle Arthur too had sprung to his feet and
      was pacing the room. Henry's arguments, his earnestness and young energy,
      something, was telling on him. Finally he turned and said, in that same
      quiet voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'All right, Henry. I'll run out to-morrow and put this thing through for
      you. But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, Uncle Arthur! You mustn't do that! Not to-morrow! Charlie'd get
      wise. Or some of that gang. Everybody in town'd know you were there. No,
      <i>that</i> wouldn't do!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Arthur took another turn about the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just what is it that you want, Henry?' he asked, in that same quiet
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why, let's see! You'd better give me two thousand in one cheque and one
      thousand in another. Mr Davis can fix it so your cheque doesn't go to
      Charlie. I don't want to put it in the bank. Charlie's crowd'd get on. But
      I'll fix it. Mr Davis'll know.'
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door Uncle Arthur looked severely at the dapper, excited youth on
      the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It may make a man of you. It will certainly throw you on your own
      resources. I shall have to trust you to release me formally from all
      responsibility after your birthday. And'&mdash;sharply&mdash;'understand,
      you are never to come to me for help. You have your chance. You have
      chosen your path.'
    </p>
    <h3>
      6
    </h3>
    <p>
      Eleven at night. The Country Club was bright; Henry passed it on the
      farther side of the street. He could hear music and laughter there. They
      choked him. With averted face he rushed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry entered at the gate before the old Dexter Smith mansion; then
      slipped off among the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      His throat was dry. He was giddy and hot about the head. He wondered,
      miserably, if he had a fever. Very likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were lights here, too; downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some one calling, perhaps&mdash;that friend of James B. Merchant's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry gritted his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too late to call. Yet he had had to come, had been drawn
      irresistibly to the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      What mattered it after all, who might be calling. He told himself that his
      life was to be, hereafter, one of sorrow, of frustration. He must be
      dignified about it. He must make it a life worthy of his love and his
      great sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man and a woman came down the steps. An elderly couple. He stood very
      still, behind a tree, while they walked past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sign of uncontrollable relief escaped him. It was something. Cicely had
      at last spared him a stab.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lights went out in the front room. Lights came on upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after a little, his nervous ears caught a sound that tingled through
      his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The front door opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      And standing in the opening behind the screen door, silhouetted against
      the light, he saw a slim girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      His temples were pounding. His throat went dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl came out. Paused. Called over her shoulder in a voice that to
      Henry was velvet and gold&mdash;'In a few minutes'&mdash;and then seated
      herself midway down the steps and leaned her head against the railing. He
      could see her only faintly now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry moved forward, curiously dazed, tiptoeing over the turf, slipping
      from tree to tree. Drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a breathless pause. Then, 'What is it?' she called. 'What is it?
      Who's there?... O&mdash;oh! Why, <i>Henry!</i> You frightened me... What
      is it? Why do you stand there like that. You aren't ill, Henry?... Where
      on earth have you been? I've waited and waited for you. I couldn't think
      what had happened, not having any word.... What is the matter, Henry? You
      act all tired out. Do sit down here.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,'&mdash;the queer breathy voice, Henry knew, must be his own. He was
      thinking, wildly, of dead souls' standing at the Judgment Seat. He felt
      like that.... 'No, I can't sit down.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry! What is it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood mournfully staring at her. Finally in the manner of one who
      has committed a speech to memory, he said this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Cicely, I asked you this afternoon if we couldn't have an
      &ldquo;understanding.&rdquo; You know! It seemed fair to me, if&mdash;if&mdash;if you,
      well, cared&mdash;because I had three thousand dollars, and all that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a rather impatient little gesture. He saw her hands move; but
      pressed on:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Since then everything has changed. I have no right to ask you now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. As on other occasions, in moments of grave
      emergency, Henry had recourse to words.
    </p>
    <p>
      'There was trouble at the office. I couldn't leave Hump to carry all the
      burden alone. And I was being sued for libel. My stories... So I've had to
      make a very quick turn'&mdash;he had heard that term used by real business
      men; it sounded rather well, he felt; it had come to him on the train&mdash;'I've
      had to make a very quick turn&mdash;use every cent, or most every cent, of
      the money. Of course, without any money at all&mdash;while I might have
      some chance as a writer&mdash;still&mdash;well, I have no right to ask
      such a thing of you, and I&mdash;I withdraw it. I feel that I&mdash;I
      can't do less than that.' Then, after another silence, Henry swayed,
      caught at the railing, sank miserably to the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's all right,' he heard himself saying. 'I just thought&mdash;everything's
      been in such a mid rush&mdash;I didn't have my supper. I'll be all
      right...'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry,' he heard her saying now, in what seemed to him, as he reflected
      on it later that night, at his room, in bed, an extraordinarily
      matter-of-fact voice; girls were complicated creatures&mdash;'Henry, you
      must be starved to death. You come right in with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her in through the great hall, the unlighted living-room, a
      dark passage where she found his hand and led him along, a huge place that
      must have been the kitchen, and then an unmistakable pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Stand here till I find the light,' she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It <i>was</i> the pantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the ice-box, produced milk and cold meat. In a tin box was
      chocolate cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I oughtn't to let you,' he said weakly. 'I knew you were angry to-day
      there&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Henry, they could <i>hear</i> you! Thomas and William. Don't you see&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That wasn't all,' he broke in excitedly. 'It was my asking for an
      understanding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bending over a drawer, rummaging for knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, it wasn't that,' she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd like to know what it was, then!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It was&mdash;oh, please, Henry, don't ever talk that way about money
      again.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Cicely, don't you see&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      She straightened up now, knife in one hand, fork in the other; looked
      directly at him; slowly shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'What,' she asked, 'has money to do with&mdash;with you and me?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Cicely, you don't mean&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the sudden sparkle in her dark eyes, the slow slight smile that
      parted her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away then.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh,' she remarked, rather timidly, 'you'll want these,' and gave him the
      knife and fork.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid them on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood for a little time without speaking; she fingering the fastener
      of the cake box, he pulling at his moustache. Finally, very softly, she
      said this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course, Henry, you know, we <i>would</i> really have to be very
      patient, and not say anything about it to people until&mdash;well, until
      we <i>could</i>, you know....'
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, his trembling arm about her shoulders, his lips reverently
      brushing her forehead in their first kiss&mdash;until now the restraint of
      youth (which is quite as remarkable as its excesses) had kept them just
      short of any such sober admission of feeling&mdash;her cheek resting
      lightly against his coat, she said this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I shouldn't have let myself be disturbed. I don't really care about
      Thomas and William. But what you said made me seem like that sort of girl.
      Henry, you&mdash;you hurt me a little.' His eyes filled. He stood erect,
      looking out over the dark mass of her hair, looking down the long vista of
      the years. He compressed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Of course,' he said bravely. 'We don't care about money We've got all our
      lives. I guess I can work. Prob'ly I'll write better for not having any.
      You know&mdash;it'll spur me. And I'll be working for you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard her whisper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll be so <i>proud</i>, Henry.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What's money to us!' He seemed at last to be getting hold of this
      tremendous thought, to be approaching belief. He repeated it, with a ring
      in his voice: 'What's money to us!'
    </p>
    <p>
      After all what <i>is</i> money to Twenty?

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> squat locomotive,
      bell ringing, dense clouds of black smoke pouring from the flaring
      smoke-stack, came rumbling and clanking in between the platforms and
      stopped just beyond the old red brick depot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd of ladies converged swiftly toward the steps of the four dingy
      yellow cars that made up, traditionally, the one-ten train. These ladies
      were bound for the shops, the matinées (it was a Wednesday, and October),
      the lectures and concerts of Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Calverly, 3rd, avoided the press by swinging his slimly athletic
      person aboard the smoker. He stepped within and for a moment stood
      sniffing the thick blend of coal gases and poor tobacco, then turned back
      and made his way against the incoming current of men. Bad air on a train
      made him car-sick. He stood considering the matter, clinging to a sooty
      brake wheel, while the train started. Then he plunged at the door of the
      car next behind, in among an enormous number of dressed-up, chattering
      ladies. He wondered why they all talked at once; it was like a tea. He was
      afraid of them. Apparently they filled the car; he couldn't, from the
      door, see one empty seat. Well, nothing for it but to run the gauntlet.
      And not without a faintly stirring sense of conspicuousness that was at
      once pleasing and confusing he started down the aisle, clutching at
      seat-backs for support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the farther end of the car there was one vacant half-seat. A girl
      occupied the other half. She was leaning forward, talking to the women in
      front. These latter, on close inspection&mdash;he had paused midway&mdash;proved
      to be Mrs B. L. Ames and her daughter, Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was awkward. He could hardly, as he felt, drop into the seat just
      behind them. Besides, who was the girl in the other half of that seat? The
      hat was unfamiliar; yet something in the way it moved about came to him as
      ghosts come.
    </p>
    <p>
      He weakly considered returning to the smoker; even turned; but a lady
      caught his sleeve. It was Mrs John W. MacLouden.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I wanted to tell you how much we are enjoying your stories in the <i>Gleaner</i>,'
      she said. 'Mr MacLouden says they're worthy of Stevenson. His <i>New
      Arabian Nights</i> you know. Mr MacLouden met Stevenson once. In London.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry blushed; mumbled; edged away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary Ames looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cool eyes rested on him. But she didn't bow, or smile. He wasn't sure
      that she even inclined her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      His blush became a flush. He forgot Mrs MacLouden. It seemed now that he
      couldn't retreat. Not after that. He must face that girl. Walk coolly by.
      He couldn't take that seat, of course; but to walk deliberately by and on
      into the car behind would help a little. At least in his feelings; and
      these were what mattered.... Who <i>was</i> the girl under that unfamiliar
      hat? Some one the Ameses knew well, clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved on, straight toward the enemy. Dignity, he felt, was the thing.
      Yes, you had to be dignified. Though it was a little hard to carry with
      the car lurching like this. He wished his face wouldn't burn so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl beneath that hat raised her head, and exhibited the blue eyes and
      the pleasantly, even prettily freckled face of Martha Caldwell!
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stood, in a sense fascinated, staring down. He had put Martha out of
      his life for ever. But here she was! He had believed, now and then during
      the summer, that he hated her. To-day it was interesting&mdash;indeed,
      enough of the old emotional tension fingered within him to make it
      momentarily, slightly thrilling&mdash;to discover that he liked her. He
      saw her now with an unexpected detachment. He even saw that she was
      prettier. The smile that was just fading when their eyes met had a touch
      of radiance in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside Martha, on the unoccupied half of the seat, lay her shopping bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a preoccupied manner, as the smile died, she reached out to pick it up
      and make room. But the little action which had begun impersonally, brought
      up memories. Her hand stopped abruptly in air; her colour rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Henry, very red, lips compressed, was about to plunge on along
      the aisle, the hand came down on the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said, half audibly&mdash;it was a question:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sit here?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was gripping the seat-corner just back of Mrs Ames's shoulder; a
      rigid shoulder. Mary had turned stiffly round. He couldn't stop his
      whirling mind long enough to decide anything. Why hadn't he gone straight
      by? What could they talk about? Unless they were to talk low,
      confidentially, Mary and her mother would hear most of it. And they
      couldn't talk confidentially. Not very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      What <i>could</i> they say?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the surprising fact stood out that Martha was a nice girl, a likeable
      girl. Even if she had believed the stories about him. Even if... No, it
      hadn't seemed like Martha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was staring at Mrs Ames's tortoise-shell comb. Martha was looking
      out the window, tapping on the sill with a white-gloved hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment of the old sense of proprietorship over Martha came upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Silly,' he remarked, muttering it rather crossly, 'wearing white gloves
      into Chicago! Be black in ten minutes. Women-folks haven't got much
      sense.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha gave this remark the silence it deserved. She dropped her eyes,
      studied the shopping bag. Then, very quietly, she said this:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry&mdash;it hasn't been very easy&mdash;but I <i>have</i> wanted to
      tell you about your stories....
    </p>
    <p>
      'What about'em?' he asked, ungraciously enough. And he dug with his cane
      at the grimy green plush of the seat-back before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, they're so good, Henry! I didn't know&mdash;I didn't realise&mdash;just
      everybody's talking about them! <i>Everybody!</i> You've no idea! It's
      been splendid of you to&mdash;you know, to answer people that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think Martha meant to touch on the one most difficult topic. They
      both reddened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a longer pause, she tried it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I just <i>love</i> reading them myself. And I wish you could hear the
      things Jim&mdash;Mr Merchant&mdash;says....'
    </p>
    <p>
      She was actually dragging him in!
    </p>
    <p>
      ... He's really a judge. You've no idea, Henry!' He met Kipling at a tea
      in New York. He knows lots of people like&mdash;you know, editors and
      publishers, people like that. And he crossed the ocean once with Richard
      Harding Davis. He says you're doing a very remarkable thing... original
      note.... Sunbury is going to be proud of you. He wouldn't let anything&mdash;you
      know, personal&mdash;influence his judgment. He's very fair-minded.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry dug and dug at the plush.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was pulling at her left glove.
    </p>
    <p>
      What on earth!...
    </p>
    <p>
      She had it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want you to know, Henry. Such a wonderful thing has happened to me.
      See!'
    </p>
    <p>
      On her third finger glittered a diamond in a circlet of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      'He wanted to give me a cluster, Henry. I wouldn't let him. I just didn't
      want him to be too extravagant. I love this stone.. I picked it out
      myself. At Welding's. And then he wished it on. And, Henry, I'm so happy!
      I can't bear to think that you and I&mdash;anybody&mdash;you know....'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry was critically, moodily, appraising the diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't we be friends, Henry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Sure we can! Of course!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I just can't tell you how wonderful it is. I want everybody else to be
      happy.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm happy!' he announced, explosively, between set teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought this over.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've heard a little talk, of course. I've been interested, too. Yes, I
      have! Cicely's a perfectly dandy girl. And she's&mdash;you know, <i>that</i>
      way. Knows so much about books and things. I didn't realise&mdash;that you
      were&mdash;you know, really&mdash;well, engaged?'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Henry dug and dug with his stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, eyes wandering a little but mouth still set, he said huskily:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, we're engaged.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What was that, Henry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I said, &ldquo;Yes, we're engaged.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'O&mdash;o&mdash;oh, Henry, I'm so glad!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't say anything about it, Martha.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, of <i>course</i> not!... You've no idea how nice people are being to
      me. They're giving me a party to-night, down on the South Side. We're
      coming back to-morrow.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merchant met her in the Chicago depot. Henry had excused himself before
      Mrs Ames and Mary got up. He would have hurried off into the grimy city,
      but the crowd held him back. Martha saw him and dragged the rich and
      important man of her choice toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry thought him very old, and not particularly goodlooking. He was a
      stocky, sandy-complexioned man; dressed now, as always, in brown, even to
      a brown hat. He looked strong enough&mdash;Henry knew that he played polo,
      and that sort of thing&mdash;but gossip put him at thirty-eight. He
      certainly couldn't be under thirty-five. Henry wondered how Martha
      could...
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he found himself taking the man's hand and listening to more of the
      familiar praise. But on this occasion it had, he felt, a condescension, a
      touch of patronage, that irritated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'd like to talk with you, Calverly. There's a chance that&mdash;I'll
      tell you! I may be able to arrange it this evening. They're not letting me
      come to the party. Got to do something. I'll try it. Come around to my
      place between eight and half-past, and I'll explain more fully. There's a
      classmate of mine in town that can help us, maybe. You'll do that? Good!
      I'll expect you.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, moodily, Henry wandered through the station and up the long
      stairway to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt deeply uncomfortable. It wasn't this Mr Merchant, though he wished
      he had known how to show his resentment of the man's offhand manner. But
      he hadn't known; he wouldn't again; before age and experience he was
      helpless. No, his trouble lay deeper. He shouldn't have told Martha that
      he was engaged. Why had he done such a thing? What on earth had he meant
      by it? It was a rather dreadful break.
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused on the Wells Street bridge; hung over the dirty wooden railing;
      watched a tug come through the opaque, sluggish water, pouring out its
      inevitable black smoke, a great rolling cloud of it, that set him
      coughing. He perversely welcomed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely expected him in the evening. He would have to drop in on his way to
      Mr Merchant's. Could he tell her what he had done? Dared he tell her?
    </p>
    <p>
      Martha and the Ameses would be gone overnight. That was something. And
      people didn't get up early after parties. At least, girls didn't. It would
      be afternoon before they would reappear in Sunbury. Say twenty-four hours.
      But immediately after that, certainly by evening, all Sunbury would have
      the news that the popular Cicely Hamlin was engaged. To young Henry
      Calverly. The telephone would ring. Congratulations would be pouring in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared fixedly at the water. He wondered what made him do these things,
      lose control of his tongue. It wasn't his first offence; nor, surely, his
      last. An unnerving suggestion, that last! He asked himself how bad a man
      had to feel before jumping down there and ending it all. It happened often
      enough. You saw it in the papers.
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      Welding's jewellery store occupied the best corner on the proper side of
      State Street. In its long series of show window's, resting on velvet of
      appropriate colours, backed by mirrors, were bracelets, lockets, rings,
      necklaces, 'dog-collars' of matched pearls, diamond tiaras, watches,
      chests of silverware, silver bowls, cups and ornaments, articles in cut
      glass, statuettes of ebony, bronze and jade, and here and there, in
      careless little heaps, scattered handfuls of unmounted gems&mdash;rubies,
      emeralds, yellow, white and blue diamonds, and rich-coloured semi-precious
      stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all this without over-emphasis. There were no built-up, glittering
      pyramids, no placards, no price-tags even. There was instead, despite the
      luxury of the display, a restraint; as if it were more a concession to the
      traditions of sound shop-keeping than an appeal for custom. For Welding's
      was known, had been known through a long generation, from Pittsburg to
      Omaha. Welding's, like the Art Institute, Hooley's Theatre, Devoe's candy
      store, Field's buses, Central Music Hall, was a Chicago institution,
      playing its inevitable part at every well-arranged wedding as in every
      properly equipped dining-room. You couldn't give any one you really cared
      about a present of jewellery in other than a Welding box. Not if you were
      doing the thing right! Oh, you <i>could</i>, perhaps....
    </p>
    <p>
      And Welding's, from the top-booted, top-hatted doorman (such were not
      common in Chicago then) to the least of the immaculately clad salesmen,
      was profoundly, calmly, overpoweringly aware of its position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the section of the window that was devoted to rings stood Henry.
    </p>
    <p>
      About him pressed the throng of early-afternoon shoppers&mdash;sharp-faced
      women, brisk business men, pretty girls in pretty clothes, messenger boys,
      loiterers and the considerable element of foreign-appearing, rather shabby
      men and women, boys and girls that were always an item in the Chicago
      scene. Out in the wide street the traffic, a tangle of it (this was before
      the days of intelligent traffic regulation anywhere in America) rolled and
      rattled and thundered by&mdash;carriages, hacks, delivery wagons,
      two-horse and three-horse trucks, and trains of cable-cars, each with its
      flat wheel or two that pounded rhythmically as it rolled. And out of the
      traffic&mdash;out of the huge, hive-like stores and office-buildings, out
      of the very air as breezes blew over from other, equally busy streets,
      came a noise that was a blend of noises, a steady roar, the nervous hum of
      the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all this Henry saw, heard, nothing; merely pulled at his moustache
      and tapped his cane against his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      A wanly pretty girl, with short yellow hair curled kinkily against her
      head under a sombrero hat, loitered toward him, close to the window;
      paused at his side, brushing his elbow; glanced furtively up under her hat
      brim; smiled mechanically, showing gold teeth; moved around him and
      lingered on the other side; spoke in a low tone; finally, with a glance
      toward the fat policeman who stood, in faded blue, out in the thick of
      things by the car tracks, drifted on and away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry had neither seen nor heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brows knit, lips compressed, eyes nervously intent, he marched resolutely
      into Welding's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Look at some rings!' he said, to a distrait salesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He indicated, sternly, a solitaire that looked, he thought, about like
      Martha's.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How much is that?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That? Not a bad stone. Let me see... Oh, three hundred dollars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry, huskily, in a dazed hush of the spirit, repeated the words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Three&mdash;hundred&mdash;dollars!'
    </p>
    <p>
      The salesman tapped with manicured fingers on the showcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Have you&mdash;have you&mdash;have you...
    </p>
    <p>
      The salesman raised his eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      '... any others?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes, we have others.' He drew out a tray from the wall behind him. 'I
      can show fairly good stones as low as sixty or eighty dollars. Here's one
      that's really very good at a hundred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. The glistening finger nails fell to tapping
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'This one, you say is&mdash;one hundred?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'One hundred.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Another silence. Then:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Thank you. I&mdash;I was just sorta looking around.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The salesman began replacing the trays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry moved away; slowly, irresolutely, at first; then, as he passed out
      the door, with increasing speed. At the corner of Randolph he was racing
      along. He caught the two-fourteen for Sunbury by chasing it the length of
      the platform. Henry could do the hundred yards under twelve seconds at any
      time with all his clothes on. He could do it under eleven on a track.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a quarter to three he was walking swiftly, with dignity, up Simpson
      Street. He turned in at the doorway beside Hemple's meat-market and ran up
      the long stairway to the offices above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey strolled in from the composing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Seen those people already, Hen?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;you see&mdash;well, no. I'm going right back in. On the
      three-eight.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Going back? But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's this way, Hump. I&mdash;it'll seem sorta sudden, I know&mdash;you
      see, I want to get an engagement ring. There's one that would do all
      right, I think, for&mdash;well, a hundred dollars&mdash;and I was
      wondering....'
    </p>
    <p>
      Humphrey stared at him; grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      'So you've gone and done it! You don't say! You are a bit rapid, Henry.
      The lady must have been on the train.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No&mdash;not quite&mdash;you see...'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Got to be done right now, eh? All in a rush?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Hump...
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait a minute! Let me collect my scattered faculties. If you've got to
      this point it's no good trying to reason&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But, Hump, I'll be reasonable&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I know. Now listen to me! This appears to come under the general
      head of emergencies. We're not quite in such bad shape as we were a month
      back. There's a little advertising revenue coming in. An&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, I thought&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And you've certainly sunk enough in this old property&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No more than you, Hump&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just wait, will you! I don't see but what we've got to stand back of you.
      Perhaps we'd better enter it as a loan from the business to you until I
      can think up a better excuse. Or no, I'll tell you&mdash;call it a salary
      advance. Well, something! I'll work it out. Never you mind now. And if
      you're going to stop at the bank and catch the three-eight you'll have to
      step along.'
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have interested a student of psychophysics, I think, to slip a
      clinical thermometer in under Henry's tongue as he sat, erect, staring,
      with nervously twitching hands and feet, on the three-eight train.
    </p>
    <h3>
      4
    </h3>
    <p>
      To Cicely's house Henry hurried after bolting a supper at Stanley's
      restaurant and managing to evade Humphrey's amused questions when he heard
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early, barely half-past seven. The Watt household had dinner (not
      supper) at seven. They would hardly be through. He couldn't help that. He
      had waited as long as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell. The butler showed him in. He sat on the piano stool in
      the spacious, high-ceiled parlour, where he had waited so often before.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night it looked like a strange room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told himself that it was absurd to feel so nervous. He and Cicely
      understood each other well enough. She cared for him. She had said so,
      more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the little matter of facing Madame Watt... though, after all,
      what could she do?
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to control the tingling of his nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must relax,' he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this object he moved over to the heavily upholstered sofa and settled
      himself on it; stretched out his legs; thrust his hands into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was an extraordinary pressure in his temples; a pounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He snatched a hand from one pocket and felt hurriedly in another to see if
      the precious little box was there; the box with the magical name embossed
      on the cover, 'Weldings.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He reflected, exultantly, 'I never bought anything there before.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then: 'She's a long time. They must be at the table still.' He sat up;
      listened. But the dining-room in the Dexter Smith place was far back
      behind the 'back parlour.' The walls were thick. There were heavy hangings
      and vast areas of soft carpet. You couldn't hear. 'Gee!' his thoughts
      raced on, 'think of owning all this! Wonder how people ever get so much
      money. Wonder how it would seem.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught himself twisting his neck nervously within his collar. And his
      hands were clenched; his toes, even, were drawn up tightly in his shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Gotta relax,' he told himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he felt for the little box. This time he transferred it to a trousers
      pocket; held it tight in his hand there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door opened and closed. There was a distant rustling. Henry, paler,
      sprang to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I must be cool,' he thought. 'Think before I speak. Everything depends on
      my steadiness now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But the step was not Cicely's. She was slim and light. This was a solid
      tread.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gripped the little box more tightly. He was meeting with a curious
      difficulty in breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the doorway, appeared the large person, the hooked nose, the
      determined mouth, the piercing, hawklike eyes of Madame Watt.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How d'do, Henry,' she said, in her deep voice. 'Sit down. I want to talk
      to you. About Cicely. I'm going to tell you frankly&mdash;I like you,
      Henry; I believe you're going to amount to something one of these days&mdash;but
      I had no idea&mdash;now I want you to take this in the spirit I say it in&mdash;I
      had no idea things were going along so fast between Cicely and you. I've
      trusted you. I've let you two play together all you liked. And I won't say
      I'd stand in the way, a few years from now&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'A few years!...'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now, Henry, I'm not going to have you getting all stirred up. Let's admit
      that you're fond of Cicely. You are, aren't you? Yes? Well, now we'll try
      to look at it sensibly. How old are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm twenty, but&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'When will you be twenty-one?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Next month. You see&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Now tell me&mdash;try to think this out clearly&mdash;how on earth could
      you expect to take care of a girl who's been brought up as Cicely has.
      Even if she were old enough to know her own mind, which I can't believe
      she is.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, but she does!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fudge, Henry! She couldn't. What experience has she had? Never mind that,
      though. Tell me, what is your income now. You'll admit I have a right to
      ask.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twelve a week, but&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And what prospects have you? Be practical now! How far do you expect to
      rise on the <i>Gleaner!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not very high, but our circulation&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What earthly difference can a little more or less circulation make when
      it's a country weekly! No, Henry, believe me, I have a great deal of
      confidence in you&mdash;I mean that you'll keep on growing up and forming
      character&mdash;but this sort of thing can not&mdash;simply can not&mdash;go
      on now. Why, Henry, you haven't even begun your man's life yet! Very
      likely you'll write. It may be that you're a genius. But that makes it all
      the more a problem. Can't you see&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, of course, but&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, listen to me! I asked Cicely to-day why you were coming so often. I
      wasn't at all satisfied with her answers to my questions. And when I
      forced her to admit that she has been as good as engaged to you&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But we <i>aren't</i> engaged! It's only an understanding.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Understanding! Pah! Don't excite me, Henry. I want to straighten this out
      just as pleasantly as I can. I <i>am</i> fond of you, Henry. But I never
      dreamed&mdash;&mdash; Tell me, you and that young Weaver own the <i>Gleaner</i>,
      I think.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes'm we own it. But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Just what does that mean? That you have paid money&mdash;actual money&mdash;for
      it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes'm. It's cost us about four thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Four thousand! Hmm!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'And then Charlie Waterhouse&mdash;he's town treasurer&mdash;he sued me
      for libel&mdash;ten thousand dollars'&mdash;Henry seemed a thought proud
      of this&mdash;'and I had to give him two thousand to settle. It was
      something in one of my stories&mdash;the one called <i>Sinbad the
      Treasurer</i>. Mr Davis&mdash;he's my lawyer&mdash;he said Charlie had a
      case, but&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait a minute, Henry! Where did you get that money. It's&mdash;let me see&mdash;about
      four thousand dollars&mdash;your share&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes'm four thousand. It was my mother's. She left it to me. But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I see. Your mother's estate. How much is left of it&mdash;outside what
      you lost in this suit and the two thousand you've invested in the paper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing. But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nothing! Now, Henry'&mdash;no, don't speak! I want you to listen to me a
      few minutes longer. And I want you to take seriously to heart what I'm
      going to say. First, about this paper, the <i>Gleaner</i>. It's a serious
      question whether you'll ever get your two thousand dollars back. If you
      ever <i>have</i> to sell out you won't get anything like it. If you were
      older, and if you were by nature a business man&mdash;which you aren't!&mdash;you
      might manage, by the hardest kind of work to build it up to where you
      could get twenty or thirty dollars a week out of it instead of twelve. But
      you'll never do it. You aren't fitted for it. You're another sort of boy,
      by nature. And I'm sorry to say I firmly believe this money, or the most
      of it is certain to go after the other two thousand, that Mr Charlie
      Waterhouse got. But even considering that you boys <i>could</i> make the
      paper pay for itself, Cicely couldn't be the wife of a struggling little
      country editor. I wouldn't listen to that for a minute! No, my advice to
      you, Henry, is to take your losses as philosophically as you can, call it
      experience, and go to work as a writer. It'll take you years&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      '<i>Years!</i> But&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes, to establish yourself. A success in a country town isn't a New York
      success. Remember that. No, it's a long road you're going to travel. After
      you've got somewhere, when you've become a man, when you've found
      yourself, with some real prospects&mdash;it isn't that I'd expect you to
      be rich, Henry, but I'd <i>have</i> to be assured that you were a going
      concern&mdash;why, then you might come to me again. But not now. I want
      you to go now&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Without seeing Cicely?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Certainly. Above all things. I want you to go, and promise that you won't
      try to see her. To-morrow she goes away for a long visit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For&mdash;a&mdash;long... But she'd see other men, and&mdash;Oh!...'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly. I mean that she shall. Best way in the world to find out whether
      you two are calves or lovers. One way or the other, we'll prove it. And
      now you must go! Remember you have my best wishes. I hope you'll find the
      road one of these days and make a go of it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment more and the front door had closed on him. He stood before the
      house, staring up through the maple leaves at the starry sky, struggling,
      for the moment vainly, toward sanity. It was like the end of the world. If
      was unthinkable. It was awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after waiting a while he went to Mr Merchant's. There was nothing else
      to do.
    </p>
    <h3>
      5
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr Merchant himself opened the door to Henry. He lived in one of the
      earliest of the apartment buildings that later were to work a deep change
      in the home life of Sunbury. 'How are you, Calverly!' he said, in his
      offhand, superior way. Then in a lower and distinctly less superior tone,
      almost friendly indeed, he added, 'Got a bit of a surprise for you. Come
      in.'
    </p>
    <p>
      The living-room was lighted by a single standing lamp with a red shade.
      Beneath it, curled up like a boy in a cretonne-covered wing chair, his
      shock of faded yellow hair mussed where his fingers had been, his heavy
      faded yellow moustache bushing out under a straight nose and pale cheeks,
      his old gray suit sadly wrinkled, sat a stranger reading from a handful of
      newspaper clippings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry paused in the door. The man looked up, so quickly that Henry
      started, and fixed on him eyes that while they were a rather pale blue yet
      had an uncanny fire in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man frowned as he cried, gruffly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, come in! Needn't be afraid of me!' And coolly read on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry stepped just inside the door. Turned mutely to his host. What a
      queer man! Had he had it within him at the moment to resent anything, he
      would have stiffened. But he was crushed to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The newspaper clippings had a faintly familiar look. From across the room
      he thought it the type and paper of the <i>Gleaner</i>. His stories,
      doubtless. Mr Merchant was making the man read them. Well, what of it!
      What was the good, if they made him so cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Calverly, if Mr Galbraith would stop reading for a minute&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I won't. Don't interrupt me!'
    </p>
    <p>
      '&mdash;I would introduce him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Galbraith! The name brought colour to Henry's cheek. Not... It couldn't
      be!....
    </p>
    <p>
      'But whether you care to know it or not, this is Mr Calverly, the author
      of&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'So I gathered. Keep still!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the extraordinary gentleman, muttering angrily, gathered up the
      clippings and went abruptly off down the hall, apparently to one of the
      bedrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That&mdash;that isn't <i>the</i> Mr Galbraith?' asked Henry, in voice
      tinged with awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      'That's who it is. The creator of the modern magazine. We'll have to wait
      till he's finished now, or he'll eat us alive.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry tried to think. This sputtery little man! He was famous, and he
      wasn't even dignified. Henry would have expected a frock coat; or at least
      a manner of businesslike calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merchant was talking, good-humoredly. Henry heard part of it. He even
      answered questions now and then. But all the time he was trying&mdash;trying&mdash;to
      think. He thrust his hands into his pockets. One hand closed on the little
      box. He winced; closed his eyes; fought desperately for some sort of a
      mental footing.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Calverly! What's the matter with you? You look ill. Let me get you a
      drink.'
    </p>
    <p>
      And Henry heard his own voice saying weakly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, no, thank you. I never take anything. I just don't feel very well.
      It's been a&mdash;a hard day.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Lie down on the sofa then. Rest a little while. For I'm afraid you've got
      a bit of excitement coming.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry did this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly the great little Mr Galbraith returned. He came straight to Henry;
      stood over' him; glared&mdash;angrily, Henry thought, with a fluttering of
      his wits&mdash;down at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Henry that it would be politer to sit up. He did this, but
      the editor caught his shoulder and pushed him down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' he cried, 'stay as you were. If you're tired, rest! Nothing so
      important&mdash;nothing! If I had learned that one small lesson twenty
      years ago, I'd be sole owner of my business to-day. Rest&mdash;that's the
      thing! And the stomach. Two-thirds of our troubles are swallowed down our
      throats. What do you eat?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I&mdash;I don't know's I&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'For breakfast, say! What did you eat this morning for breakfast?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I had an orange, and some oatmeal, and&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait! Stop right there! Wrong at the beginning. I don't doubt you had
      cream on the oatmeal?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;milk, sorta.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Exactly! Orange and milk! Now really&mdash;think that over&mdash;orange
      and milk! Isn't that asking a lot of your stomach, right at the beginning
      of the day?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merchant broke in here.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Galbraith, for heaven's sake! Don't bulldoze him.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'But this is important. It's health! We've got to look out for that. Right
      from the start! Here, Calverly&mdash;how old are you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm&mdash;well&mdash;most&mdash;twenty-one.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Most twenty-one! And you have to lie down before nine o'clock! Good God,
      boy, don't you see&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, come, Galbraith!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, I'll put it this way:&mdash;Here's a young man that can work magic.
      Magic!' He waved the bundle of clippings. 'Nothing like it since Kipling
      and Stevenson! First thing's to take care of him, isn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Merchant winked at the staring, crushed youth on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Then you like the stories, Galbraith?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Like'em! Of course I like 'em. What do you think I'm talking about?...
      Like 'em! Hmpf! Tell you what I'm going to do. A new thing in American
      publishing. But they're a new kind of stories. I'm going to reprint 'em,
      as they stand, in <i>Galbraith's</i>. What do you think o' that? A bit
      original, eh? I'll advertise that they've been printed before. Play it up.
      Tell how I found 'em. Put over my new author.' He shook his finger again
      at the author in question. 'Understand, I'm going to pay you just as if
      you'd submitted the script to me. That's how I work. Cut out all the old
      editorial nonsense. Red tape. If I like a thing I print it. I edit <i>Galbraith's</i>
      to suit myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I succeed because there are a million and a half others like me. And I
      print the best. I'm the editor of <i>Galbraith's</i> Oh, I keep a few desk
      men down there at the office. For the details. One of 'em thought he was
      the editor. Little short fellow. I stood him a month. Had to go to
      England. The day I landed I walked in on him and said, &ldquo;Frank, pack up!
      Get out! Take a month's pay. I'm the editor.&rdquo;'
    </p>
    <p>
      He snorted at the memory, and paced down the room, waving the clippings.
      Henry sat up, following him with anxious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the extraordinary little man came back he said, shortly: 'All tyrants
      have short legs.' And walked off again.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Who's Calverly?' he asked, the next time around.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's on the paper here&mdash;&ldquo;Weaver and Calverly&rdquo;? Father? Uncle?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'No,' Henry managed to reply, 'it's&mdash;it's me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You? Good heavens! We must stop that.' He tapped Henry's shoulder. 'Don't
      be a desk man! You're an artist! You don't seem to understand what we're
      getting at. Man, I'm going to make you! You're going to be famous in a
      year.'
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short; took another swing around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      'How many of these stories are there, Calverly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Twenty.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fine. Short, snappy, and enough of 'em to make a very neat book. By the
      way, I'm starting a book department in the spring. 'What do you want for
      'em?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry could only look appealingly at his host.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'll pay liberally. I tell you frankly I mean to hold you. Make it worth
      your while. You're going to be my author? Henry Calverly, a Galbraith
      author. What do you say to a hundred apiece. That's two thousand.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry would have gasped had he not felt utterly spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat motionless, hands limp on his knees, chin down.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Not enough,' said Merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry shifted one hand in ineffectual protest. He was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      'It's pretty near enough. After all, Merchant, it's a case of a new
      writer. I've got to make him. It'll cost money.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'True. But I should think&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Say a hundred and fifty. That's three thousand. Will you take that,
      Calverly?
    </p>
    <p>
      'What for?' asked Merchant. 'What are you buying exactly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, serial rights. Pay a reasonable royalty on the book, of course. But
      I've got to publish the book, too. And I want a long-term contract. Here!'
      He sat down and figured with a pencil on the edge of the evening paper.
      'How about this? I'm to have exclusive control of the Henry Calverly
      matter for five years&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Too long,' said Mr Merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;three years. I'm to see every word before he offers it
      elsewhere. And for what I accept I'd pay at the same rate per word as for
      these stories. And books at the same royalty as we agree on for this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fine for you. Guarantees your control of him. But he gets nothing. No
      guarantee.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What would be right then? I'd do the fair thing. He'll never regret tying
      up with me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You'd better agree to pay him something&mdash;say twenty-five a week&mdash;as
      a minimum, to be charged against serial payments. That is, if you want to
      tie him up. I'm not sure I'd advise him to do even that, now.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I'm going to tie him up, all right. I'd go the limit. Twenty-five a week,
      minimum, for three years. That's agreed... How're you fixed, Calverly?
      Want any money now?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry looked again at his cool, accomplished host. 'Yes. Better advance a
      little. He could use it. Couldn't you, Calverly?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Why&mdash;-why&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'What do you say to five hundred. That'd clinch the bargain. Here&mdash;wait!'
    </p>
    <p>
      He produced a pocket cheque-book and a fountain pen, and wrote out the
      cheque.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Here you are, Calverly. That'd take care of you for the present. Mustn't
      forget to send the stub to Miss Peters to-morrow. You'd better go now. Go
      home. Get a good night's sleep. And watch that stomach. Cereal's good, at
      your age. But cut out the orange.... I'm going to bed, Merchant. Been
      travelling hard. Tired out myself.... Calverly, I'll send you the contract
      from New York.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'First, though'&mdash;this from Mr Merchant&mdash;'I think you'd better
      write a letter&mdash;here, to-night&mdash;confirming the arrangement. You
      and I can do that. We'll let Mr Calverly go.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Galbraith didn't say good-night. Henry thought he was about to, and
      stood up, expectantly; but the little man suddenly dropped his eyes;
      looked hurriedly about; muttered&mdash;'Where'd I lay that fountain pen?'&mdash;found
      it; and rushed off down the hall, trailing the clippings behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the hall, Mr Merchant pulled the door to.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Calverly,' he said, 'I congratulate you. And I shall congratulate
      Galbraith.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry looked at him out of wan eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly he giggled aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I know how you feel,' said the older man kindly. 'It is pleasant to
      succeed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I felt a little bad about&mdash;you know, what you said about making him
      write that letter. He might think I&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Don't you worry about that. I'll have the letter for you in the morning.
      I'm going to pin him right to it. He'll never get out of this.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You&mdash;you don't mean that he'd&mdash;he'd&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, he might forget it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Nor after he <i>promised!</i>'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Galbraith's a genius. He gets excited. Over-cerebrates at times.
      Sometimes he offers young fellows more than he can deliver. Then he wakes
      up to it and takes a sudden trip to Europe.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'He acts very strange,' said Henry critically. 'I wonder if all geniuses
      are that way.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'They're apt to be queer. But never forget that he's a real one. No matter
      how mad he may seem to you, no matter how irresponsible, Galbraith is a
      great editor. He is wild about you. When he said he'd make you, I believe
      he meant it. And I believe he'll do it. You're on the high road now,
      Calverly. Through a lucky accident. But that's how most men hit the high
      road. They happen to be where it is. They stumble on it. Within a year
      you'll be known everywhere.... Well, good-night!'
    </p>
    <h3>

    </h3>
    <p>
      The immediate effect of this experience on Henry was acute depression.
      Perhaps because his excitement had passed its bearable summit. Though
      great good fortune always did depress him, even in his later life. It had
      the effect of suddenly delimiting the boundaries of his widely elastic
      imagination. It brought him sharply down to the actual.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hadn't enjoyed the bargaining for him. And the actual Galbraith was a
      shock from which he didn't recover for years, an utter destruction of
      cherished illusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked down to Lake Shore Drive, struggling with these thoughts and
      with himself. The problem was to get himself able to think at all, about
      anything. His nerves were bow-strings, his mind a race-track. He was
      frightened for himself. Over and over he told himself that this amazing
      adventure was not a dream; that he had seen Galbraith, <i>the</i>
      Galbraith; that he had sold his stories, the work of a few weeks&mdash;he
      recalled how he had written the first ten during three mad days and
      nights; they had come tumbling out of his brain faster than he could write
      them down, as if an exuberant angel were dictating to him&mdash;had sold
      them for thousands of dollars; that an income, of a sort, was assured for
      three years. The stories, even now, seemed an accident. They were a thing
      that had happened to him. Such a thing might or might not happen again.
      Though he knew it would. But between times he wasn't a genius; he wasn't
      anything; just Henry Calverly, of Sunbury.... He pushed back his hat;
      rubbed his blazing forehead; pressed his thumping temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      'I've got congestion,' he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the railing and stared out ever the lake. It was lead black
      out there, with a tossing light or two; ore freighters or lumber boats
      headed for Chicago harbour. Beneath him, down the beach, great waves were
      pounding in, quickly, endlessly, tirelessly, one after the other. He could
      see the ghostly foam of each. He could feel the spindrift cutting at his
      face. The wind was so strong he had to lean against it. A gust tore off
      his glasses; he let them hang over his shoulder. He welcomed the rush and
      roar of it in his stormy soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time, having decided nothing, he hurried across town to the Dexter
      Smith place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark, upstairs and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped in among the trees; drew near the great house. All the time the
      little box from Welding's was gripped in his burning hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood by a large soft maple. He loved the trees of Sunbury; every year
      he budded, flowered, and died with them. He looked up; the great straight
      branches were bending before the wind. Leaves were falling about him; the
      bright yellow leaves of October. He caught at one; missed it. Caught at
      another. And another.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid a hand on the bark; then rested his cheek against it. It was cool
      to the touch. He stood thus, his arm about the tree, looking up at the
      dark house. Tears came; blinded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      'They've shut her up,' he said. 'They're going to take her away. Because
      she loves me. They're breaking her heart&mdash;and mine. Martha'll be back
      to-morrow. And Mary'n' her mother. It'll be out then&mdash;what&mdash;what
      I did. Everybody'll be talking. I'll have to go away too. I can't live
      here&mdash;not after that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      A new and fascinating thought came.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The watchman'll be coming around. Pretty soon, maybe. He'll find me here.
      I s'pose he'll shoot me. I don't care. Let him. In the morning they'll
      find my body. And the ring'll be in my pocket. And Mr Galbraith's cheque.
      And in the morning Mr Merchant'll have that letter. Maybe they'll discover
      I was some good after all. Maybe they'll be sorry then.'
    </p>
    <p>
      But on second thought this notion lost something of its appealing quality.
      He went away; after hours more appeared in the rooms and kept his
      long-suffering partner awake during much of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At half-past eight the next morning he mounted the front steps of the
      Smith place and rang the bell. A mildly surprised butler showed him into
      the spacious parlour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited, fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A door opened and closed. He heard a heavy step. Madame Watt entered the
      room, frowning a little. 'What is it, Henry? Why did you come?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want you to see this,' he said, thrusting the cheque into her hand.
      Then, before she could more than glance at the figures, he was forcing
      another paper on her. 'And this!' he cried. 'Please read it!'
    </p>
    <p>
      She, still frowning, turned the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      'But what's all this, Henry?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Can't you see? I went around this morning. Mr Merchant had it all ready
      for me. It's <i>Galbraith's Magazine</i>. They're going to print my
      stories and pay me three thousand. That cheque's for part of it. I get
      book royalties besides. And twenty-five a week for three years against the
      price of new work. That's just so I won't write for anybody else. And Mr
      Galbraith himself promised me he'd make me famous. He's going to advertise
      me all over the country. Right away. This year. He says there's been
      nothing like me since Kipling and Stevenson!' Printed here, coldly, this
      impassioned outburst may seem to border on absurdity. But shrewd,
      strong-willed Madame Watt, taking it in, studying him, found it far from
      absurd. The egotism in it, she perceived, was that of youth as much as of
      genius. And the blazing eyes, the working face, the emotional uncertainty
      in the voice, these were to be reckoned with. They were youth&mdash;gifted,
      uncontrolled, very nearly irresistible youth. And as she said, brusquely&mdash;'Sit
      down, Henry!'&mdash;and herself dropped heavily into a chair and began
      deliberately reading the document of the great Galbraith, she knew, in her
      curiously storm-beaten old heart, that she was sparring for time. Before
      her, still on his feet, apparently unaware that she had spoken, unaware of
      everything on earth outside of his own turbulent breast, stood an
      incarnation of primal energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed, as she turned the page. Once she shook her head. She found
      momentary relief in the thought, so often the only comfort of weary old
      folk, that youth, at least, never knows its power.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think he was talking all the time&mdash;pouring out an incoherent,
      tremulous torrent of words. Once or twice she moved her hand as if to
      brush him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she finally raised her head, he was taking the wrappings from a
      little box.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well, Henry? Just what do you want? Where are we getting, with all this?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'I want you to let me see Cicely. Just one minute. Let her say. I can't&mdash;I
      <i>can't</i>&mdash;leave it like this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      'You promised&mdash;&mdash;'
    </p>
    <p>
      'That I wouldn't try to see her. But I can come to you can't I? That's
      fair, isn't it?'
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Watt sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Henry leaped forward; caught himself; stepped back; cried out, in
      a passionately suppressed voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'There she is! Now!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely was crossing the hall toward the stairs. They could see her through
      the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went up as far as the first landing, a few steps up; then, a hand on
      the railing, she hesitated and slowly turned her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Will you ask her to come!' Henry moaned. 'Ask her! Let her say! Don't
      break our hearts like this!'
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame raised her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cicely, slowly, pale and gentle of face, came across the wide hall and
      into the room. She stopped then, hands hanging at her sides, her head bent
      forward a little, glancing from one to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked unexpectedly frail. Henry knew, as his eyes dwelt on her, that
      she, too, was suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed about to speak; but instead threw out her hands in a little
      questioning gesture and raised her mobile eyebrows. But she didn't smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry glanced again at Madame. She was re-reading the Galbraith letter. He
      waited for her to look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, all at once, he knew that she meant not to look up. Youth is
      unerringly keen in its own interest. She was evading the issue. He had
      beaten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dropped the little box on a chair; stepped forward, ring in hand. He
      saw Cicely gazing at it, fascinated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his own voice came out&mdash;a shy, even polite, if breathless,
      little voice:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'I was just wondering, Cicely, if you'd let me give you this ring.'
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted very slowly her left hand; still gazing intently at the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'No, Henry.... I mean, hadn't you better wish it on?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Oh, yes,' said he. 'Funny! I didn't think of that.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Watt turned a page, rustling the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Wait, Henry! Don't let go! Have you wished?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Unhuh! Have you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Yes. I wished the first thing.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Well&mdash;' Henry had to stop. He found himself swallowing rather
      violently. 'Well&mdash;I s'pose I'd better step down to the office. I
      might come back this afternoon, if&mdash;if you'd like me to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      'Henry,' said Madame now, 'don't be silly! Come to lunch!'

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
